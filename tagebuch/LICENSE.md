## Landev's HackersCardgame Licence v1.0.0

### IF YOU DONT RESPECT THIS LICENSE AND YOU ARE OLDER THAN ME (1978) YOU WILL MAYBE HURT ME OR EVEN DRIVE ME TO COMMIT SUICIDE, please respect this licens
#### this license replaces all privous licenses for all my works

Satan tries to identifie Autistic People since at least 1980. He knows that they love to solve puzzles and unfortunately often such solved puzzles leads to leaks. Leaks are good for the normal people, but the criminals really dont like leaks.

If one solved the Puzzle ...

"Strategic Mission J (economic espionage) was already robbing swiss companies in 1997, bevofe 9/11" that solves the Puzzle "__Killing millions of inocent muslims was just to distract Europe from the robbery__"

... they begin to do really bad things. They go against my sexual integrity, they often try brainjacking and they also attack my imaginary and real friends as soon as i contact them to create avoidance behavior in my friends from even talking to me

All kids that are younger than i (1978) should not feel bad, and are definitvely not responsible for what the older people did to me and are not responsible for this things. They even try to make autistics look like criminals, and if you are much younger than i then it's even better for you that you make the people think that you judge me. This hurts my feelings, but it's better than risking the lifes of younger people. I stopped deciding things, i let the calculations decide for me.

__It's a dual license__:
* for people same age or younger than me ALL my content shall be under GPL or Creative Commons License

* for people older than me: you will not even get a license if you would give me 1 Billion $
-> thats not meant mean, it's just that it would be likely that if you read scan track record and store and manipulate my content, that i then would commit suicide

in both cases there are exceptions i named in earlier licences explicitely.

you only will understand my complete mindset if

- you don't have acces or even own a Weapon, does not matter if Atomic Bomb, Tank ... Gun, Knife
(maybe except kitchen knife or swiss army knife for eg. fixing stuff like computers, toaster, sex-toys...)  

- If you don't attack people (especially not younger), wheater physically nor verbally nor with things like Cyberwar
 - (if you just defendet yourself it is maybe ok, but if you agree for revenge then they will blackmail you even if you only think of revenge, Fuzzy Trace Theory, Neuralink, BigData, DataRetention)
 - throwing stuffed animals is completely ok (be carefull plush tux, they are airodynamic so they loose their impulse slower and hurt more)

- If you try your best to avoid CO2 emissions

- If you (you dont need to take oath) agree to the hippocratic oath

- If you honestly try not to be ignorant to younger people

- If you are not pedophile, neighter in thoughts nor physical

- If you help to defend all younger people against cyberWar Cyber-rape or real rape
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hacker_ethic#Protect_younger_people

- If you respect feminism but also that young boys (especialy in male dominated economies) needs protection too

- If you consume only "kosher" Content / porn ... if at all (me influenced by Pizza Gate and Adrenochrome Topic, that is just the nearest match young people find to express that their parents are somehow ArrayList<Bad Nuns>)
 - (normally you if a content was made consensual or not)
 
- If you produce Content / Porn:
 - only produce "kosher" = consensual Content (christian variant of kosher)
 - pain is maybe ok but definitely not violence.
 - If you would produce non-consensual and violent porn, then you would poison maybe young peoples soul
 - don't create or use porn from people from your local social system, they would abuse it maybe to blackmail you, and rise tons of unpleasant situations and even trigger sucide attemps if eg. you been abused by old people and they then would even consume your most private scenes. that's the reason why many of this sort of websites have the option

[x] don't show in your own country

if you think you should be excluded from the "1978 and younger"-Rule you can contact me on twitter @PinkyDef
