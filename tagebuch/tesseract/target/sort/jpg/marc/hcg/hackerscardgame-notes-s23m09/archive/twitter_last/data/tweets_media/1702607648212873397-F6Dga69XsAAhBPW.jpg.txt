So there is a planetary strategic surveillance system, and there - well, there are many of them
actually. Everything from I think off-planetary surveillance gear, which is probably the National
Reconnaissance Office and their satellite systems for surveillance like the Keyhole satellites - these
are all things most, for the most part we actually know about these things. They're on Wikipedia.
But I want to talk a little bit more about the internet side of things because I think that's really
fascinating.

So part of what we are releasing today with Der Spiegel or what has actually been released - just to
be clear on the timeline, I'm not disclosing it first, Im working as an independent journalist
summarizing the work that we have already released onto the internet as part of a publication
house that went through a very large editorial process in which we redacted all the names of
agents and information about those names, including their phone numbers and e-mail addresses.

And I should say that I actually think that the laws here are wrong, because they are in favor of an
oppressor who is criminal. So when we redact the names of people who are engaged in criminal
activity including drone murder, we are actually not doing the right thing, but i geievertTaevie]
and I think that's very important.

[applause]

We also redacted the names of victims of NSA surveillance, because we think that there's a
balance. Unfortunately there is a serious problem which is that the U.S. government asserts that
you don't have standing to prove that you've been surveilled unless we release that kind of

information, but we don't want to release that kind of information in case it could be a legitimate

comply with the ay
