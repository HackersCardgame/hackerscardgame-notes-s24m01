as early as 1999, that OpenSource movement or Creative
Commons has the better ideas than people working for
money. So it would be likely, that they tried to own young
people that live in the Open Sorce Community. They let
the young people do what they like, but if the young Nerd
or She-Nerd has a good idea they steal the idea, claming
that the idea is their intelectual property. Even erasing
