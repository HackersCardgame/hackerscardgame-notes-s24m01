‘would have substantial veriap, or one would be a subset ofthe other. It made us wonder,
‘how many books fall completly ousise ofthese circles? We need a bigger database.

Worldcat

‘Thats when we set our sights on the largest book database inthe world: Worldcat. This is a
‘Proprietary database by the non-profit OCLC, which aggregates metadata records from
libraries all over the world, in exchange forgiving those libraries access tothe fll dataset,
and having them show up in end-users’ search results.

Even though OCLC Is a non-profit, ther business model requies protecting thelr database,
‘Wel, wore sorry to say, riends at OCLO, we'e giving it all away.)

‘Over the past year, we've meticulously scraped all Worldcat records, At ist, we hit a lucky
break. Worldcat was just rong out their omplate website redesign (in Aug 2022). This
Included a substantial overhaul oftheir backend systems, introducing many security laws.
‘We immediately seized the opportunity, and were able scrape hundreds of mllons() of
tecords in mare days.

Gworldcat! .
