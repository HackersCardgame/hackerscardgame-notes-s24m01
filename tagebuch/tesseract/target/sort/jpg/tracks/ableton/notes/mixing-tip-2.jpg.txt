Mixing Tip

When mixing your track, you should almost always set below ~120Hz
to mono, meaning placed in the center of your mix. Doing so will result
in a tighter mix while maximizing available headroom. You can do this
with one of two ways. The first way is using Ableton Live 10’s ‘Utility’ to
assign any frequencies under the specified amount to be mono. The
next method is to use Mid/Side EQ. With this, you can assign a high
pass filter to the side frequencies at around 120Hz. This way, no Mid
frequencies are played out on the sides.
