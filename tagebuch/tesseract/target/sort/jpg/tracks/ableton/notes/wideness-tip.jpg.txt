Wideness Tip

EN,
0.0% 100%

You can use a delay effect known as the “Haas Effect” to add perceived
wideness to a sound. To do this, add a delay set at 100% wet to the tracks
channel, and set one side to 1ms and the other between 10-20ms. This
short difference between the left and the right channel is what tricks

the listener into thinking that the sound is wider.
