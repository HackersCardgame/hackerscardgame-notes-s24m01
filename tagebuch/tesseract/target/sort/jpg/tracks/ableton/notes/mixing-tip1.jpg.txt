MIXING TIP

When mixing, producers tend to pan everything at or near
the center, creating a cluttered-sounding mix that lacks definition.
Itâ€™s important to give your mix some dimensionality by
balancing different elements within a nice and wide stereo
field. Typically, the kick, snare, vocal, and bass stay within the
center, while percussion elements, guitar solos, and background
vocals and be panned around to achieve a better sounding mix.
