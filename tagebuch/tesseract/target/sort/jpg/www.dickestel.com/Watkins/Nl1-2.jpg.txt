Cousin Who?

Did you ever wonder what to call your mather's
cousins grandchild?) The litte rascal is your second cousin
once removed.

[Vance was confused and unknowing about the
difference between second cousins, third cousins, and
fousins once or twice removed. Thanks to my mether’s
interest in genealogy, which | share, | have sorted out these
terms

‘Your first cousins, of course, are the children of your
‘aunts and uncles. Your children, and your cousin's children,
fare SECOND cousins, Their children, in turn, are third
cousins (your grandchildren and your’ cousins
grandchildren,

The "removed" refers to a difference of ane or more
generations, 20 that your cousin's children are YOUR first
fousine once removed. Your children, and your cousin's
Grandchildren are SECOND cousins, once removed. Your
cousin's grandchildren are your’ first cousins | TWICE
removed,

Dees that make it all clear, cousin?
