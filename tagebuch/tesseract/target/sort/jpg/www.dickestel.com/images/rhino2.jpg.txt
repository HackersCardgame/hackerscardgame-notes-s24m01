Rhinoceros 2

Due to loss of habitat and poaching, only about 400
to 700 Sumatran rhinas survive. The Javan species
has dwindled to around 50. Thanks to protection
efforts in South Africa, there are over 6,000
southern white rhinos, The number of black rhinos
declined from 12,000 to 2,500 between 1968 and
1995.

At the San Diego Wild Animal Perk, with natural, 125 acre compounds, and excellent care, rhinos have produced
more offspring than any other captive breeding facility
