RUAUXIKALLI:
THE AZTEK CALENDAR

‘The Aztek calendar has always fascinated
me, Richly detailed with mysterious
symbols and shapes and tines, it's @
masterpiece of graphic art. Was it the
product of some Aztec Michaelangelo, or
did it develop over time-or perhaps one
of the few successful projects of a
committee?

Based on solar and lunar observations, the
Aztec system divides the year into 18
periods of 20 days each, and one period of
5 1/4 days, giving the standerd total of
365 1/4. Each day is represented by @
symbol, which constitute an Aztec zodiac
of sorts, including not only animals but
aso such concepts, phenomena and objects
fas mavernent, flint, and wind,

Four of these symbols were also used to
rare the years, which repeat in sequence:
Tochtli (rabbit), measured fram sunrise to
sunrise; Akatl (Reed), measured from noon
‘to noon; Tekpat (Flint), measured from
suneet to sunset, and Kali (House),
Measured from midnight to midnight,
Setting the differing beginnings times for
each year produces a year of 365 1/4
days, without resort to the leap year
system.

‘The symbols for the 20 deus appear
round the center ring (just outside the
square shaped figures that emanate fram
the central face). Scanning this iter was
challenge--it was done from a full-page
original in 18 sections, each scanned at
1808 and reduced by one half to fit into
geoPaint. The final detail is not a clear as |
‘would wish for, sa the "zodiac" subots,
already highly stylized in form, are hard to
recognize, However, each of these appears
in large and small size in its own geaPaint
file

Other aspects of the calendar (also known
as the sun stone) are the four directions,
‘and the four basic elements, earth, air,
fire and water.

collected the original material fram which
this series of graphics was taken, and
who hes devated much time to studying
the ancient Mexika/Azteka culture, and
sharing it with students of all ages.
