Mule Deer

The mule deer (odacoiteus nemionus)
is found throughout me central and
‘western united states. Deer nave adapted
fairly well to human presence and help
themselves to garden products in rural
areas. in heavily visited national parks
their apparent tameness constitutes a
danger to foolish tourists who can't
resist feeding the “cute little deer.”
