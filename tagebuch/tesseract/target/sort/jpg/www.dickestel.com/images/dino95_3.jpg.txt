New, Improved Posture

For 70 uears the American Museum of Natural History displayed a T-Rex skeleton in the standard upright,
position, New research shows that this tail-draaging upright pasture wauld have dislocated the animal's
eck. So T-Rex now stands with its backbone parallel to the ground and its tail held up. Why? Because no
â€˜impression of a dino tail dragaing along the ground has ever been found.
