Dear Summergrass Fans,

2010

On behalf of the San Diego Bluegrass Society, the San Diego North County Bluegrass
& Folk Club, and the Antique Gas & Steam Engine Museum, welcome to Summergrass
2010! We're really glad you could join us for our eighth festival event and are very proud to
bring you a great weekend of music, family activities, and enjoyment in our wonderful set-
ting, the Antique Gas & Steam Engine Museum!

Inside this program you'll find a performance schedule and other important informa-
tion to help you enjoy your visit. While you're here, try the GREAT food selections at the
various museum restaurants. Be sure to shop at our many fine vendors, pick up a new CD,
some new clothes, musical instruments and accessories, or other fine products on display.
Truly something for everyone!

We are very proud to offer for the first-time ever our inaugural Adult Bluegrass Boot
Camp for intermediate to advance adults! And we are also proud to bring back our
very special Kids Music Camp where young folks of all skill levels have the oppor-
tunity to learn bluegrass music in a supportive and fun environment. Read about
both of these camps here inside this program.
