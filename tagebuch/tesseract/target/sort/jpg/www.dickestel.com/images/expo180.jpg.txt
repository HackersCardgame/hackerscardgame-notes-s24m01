The EC-1 was used mainly by Educational Institutions and
Industrial Companies, for teaching , training and research
purposes. It was also used by electronic hobbyist.

Unlike Digital computers, Analog computers operate
continuously, limited by the frequency response of the
amplifiers and circuitry.

Analog computers were used mainly to solve and simulate
both mechanical and mathematical problems. Analog
computers were especially useful in solving Gh vione
problems in which the problem can be expressed in the form

of a differential equation.
