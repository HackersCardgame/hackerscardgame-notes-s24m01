DING ROCK STATE HISTORI
Chaw’se

For many centuries this area was the homeland of the Northern Sierra
Miwok. During the 1850's, conflict with newly arrived gold seekers forced
them from their beloved land to less desirable places.

The site was formally dedicated as a State Park in 1968. Local Native
Americans and descendants of the Miwok have worked cooperatively with
the California Department of Parks and Recreation to develop the park to
preserve their culture, traditions and heritage.

Typical village structures have been recreated and are representative of tradi-
tional designs, but no attempt has been made to reconstruct an original village.

PLEASE REMEMBER
Like the grinding rock itself, the meadow at Chaw’se is fragile. Please stay

on the trails or where the grass is mowed and do not pick the wildflowers

Gathering or removing artifacts is prohibited by State law. Leave Objects
you discover where you found them, and please notify the park staff.

“It was the Indians’ way to pass through a country without disturbing any-
thing; to pass and leave no trace, like fish through the water or birds through
the air.” Willa Cather

We hope your visit to Chaw’se will be in this spirit, and you will grow in
understanding and respect for the Native Americans of the Sierra Nevada.
