RAM

RAM is a shortcut for Random Access Memory. The chips of computers, which are used as temporary memory, are called RAM. The input - also programs and data - will be loaded into the ram before the CPU can
run this program. RAM-Chips can also be used as caches in harddisks, CD- or DVD-drives or as video ram (VRAM).

DRAM edit]

The RAM of the C64 is so-called DRAM (shortcut for Dynamic RAM). The information of a DRAM must be refreshed after a few milliseconds.
SRAM edit]
The chip-synonym of the colour RAM is 2114 with 0,6 KByte. The colour RAM used SRAM (shortcut for Static RAM). This RAM-type does not need a refresh

The RAM of the C64 can be enhanced with cartridges. The famous Memory Cartridge was built by Commodore and is called REU (RAM Expansion Unit). Another Memory cartridge is called GeoRAM, which is only used with the operating system GEOS
Pinouts of RAM chips in the C-64 [edit]

2114 1K x4 SRAM
One of these makes up the text screen color RAM at 55296-56295/SD800-DBET. Three of these chips (expandable by another 8) make up the main memory in the VIC-20.
