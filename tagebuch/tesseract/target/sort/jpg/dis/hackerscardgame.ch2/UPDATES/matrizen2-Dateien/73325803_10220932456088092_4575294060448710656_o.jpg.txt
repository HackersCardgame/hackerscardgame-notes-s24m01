EEG was originally developed by neurologist Hans
Berger. The Brain Computer Interface is an EEG that
recognizes patterns of brain currents with software
(pattem recognition, al, Deep Leaming) and can
activate events e.g. to start the loT-Toaster or more
Worse thigns lke flushing your brain or starting a
SuicideDeathBot (card b4, 16) Today with more
Computing power, there are much more possibilities
than in 1929.
