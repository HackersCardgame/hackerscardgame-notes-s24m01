A new experience in permanent chastity

â€˜My wife and keyholder was getting a bit hored with
having to supervise my daily elitty hygiene and told me to
find a solution for long term chastity without temoving
the cage at all for at least a few weeks in between hygiene
teleases. J found this eute little cage and after a little
test tun with a padlock 9 have now been locked into it
permanently by sealing the binding screw that holds
together the ting and the cage with a special resin sealant.

If the seal gets broken, I'l be in big trouble. 9 only
breaks with a considerable amount of force, like tuying
to open the serews. The black wbber O-rings are
there to protect the seal and eliminate the metallic rattling
noise that the oaige would asually maka: When 9 stated
the screw Mistress made a little math in the sealant before
it hatilened, ashe would know of 9 voea\a nadghty sieiy!

I wonder how this will feel in the long tun, and I hope

that my skin will handle it well. Due to the open build

of the cage it-should bareasy enough to'beap ie-dleawand
to put on creams and lotions to keep it smooth and healthy.
