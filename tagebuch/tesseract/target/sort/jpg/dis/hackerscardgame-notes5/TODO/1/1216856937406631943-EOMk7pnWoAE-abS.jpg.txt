So thatâ€™s a
pretty scary thing, and basically their goal is to have total surveillance of everything that they are
interested in, So there really is no boundary to what they want to do. There is only sometimes a
boundary of what they are funded to be able to do and the amount of things they're able to do at
scale. They seem to just do those things without thinking too much about it, and there are specific
tactical things where they have to target a group or an individual, and those things seem limited
either by budgets or simply by their time. And as we have released today on Der Spiegel's website,
which it should be live - | just checked, it should be live for everyone here - we actually show a
whole bunch of details about their budgets as well as the individuals involved with the NSA and the
Tailored Access Operations group in terms of numbers,

So it should give you a rough idea showing that there was a small period of time in which the
internet was really free and we did not have people from the U.S. military that were watching over it
and exploiting everyone on it, and now we see every year that the number of people who are hired

to break into people's computers as part of grand operations, those people are growing day by day,
actually, and every year there are more and more people that are allocated, and we see this growth.
