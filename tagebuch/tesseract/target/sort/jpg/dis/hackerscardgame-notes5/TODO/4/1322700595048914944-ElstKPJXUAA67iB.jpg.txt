Role/Archetype
LeChuck has the role of the bad guy in the
Lucas Arts Game Monkey Island™

or something like a “evil father"-Archetype
who often mistreat others. Or the role of an
“always drunken father"-archetype. But in
fact often the oldest children suffer the
most pain, but al4 card maybe applies too
