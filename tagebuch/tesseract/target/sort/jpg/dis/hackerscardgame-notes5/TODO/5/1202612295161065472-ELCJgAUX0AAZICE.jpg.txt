There are some sort of Death Circles in many subcultures
(m37 Card). The circle can be out of individuals or out of
companies / Juristic Persons (Mainframes)
For some kids it is just gamification and fun
Some kids really think it would be good to kill the
whistleblower / whitehat hacker, because the parents show
them the fake image of him cyber-raping innocent women on
the "inner eye" (eyel, tl...) and enable an active denial
system (t15, b1, t1) against the kids but in fact he does not
cyber rape anybody. Some kids think it's just some lesson for
the Hacker for not become Hitler, or to help him not to
become to powerful ecletben gern Some kids just
k fear der too, as Ic
ire younÂ¢ than ne" this is ok Unfonpetely the
PsyOPs kills 1 ou of 80 and then dtl card is played against
the circle of kids and also against the parents circle to make
them do what Satan want them to do.
