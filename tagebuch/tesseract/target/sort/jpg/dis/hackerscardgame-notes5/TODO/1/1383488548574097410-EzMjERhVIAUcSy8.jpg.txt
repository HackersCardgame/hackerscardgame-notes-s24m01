GCHQ. So it’s a race condition. And so they basically are able to control this whole system and then
localize attacks in that process.

So that’s a pretty - pretty scary stuff, actually. And while it is a digital thing, | think it’s important to
understand that this is what Jefferson talked about when he talked about tyranny. This is turnkey
tyranny, and it's not that it’s coming, it’s actually here. It’s just merely a question about whether or
not they'll use it in a way that we think is a good way or not a good way.

ne of the scariest parts about this is that for this system or these sets of systems to exist, we have
been kept vulnerable. So itis the case that if the Chinese, if the Russians, if people here wish to
build this system, there's nothing that stops them. And in fact the NSA has in a literal sense
retarded the process by which we would secure the internet because it establishes a hegemony of
power, their power in secret to do these things. And in fact I've seen evidence that shows that there
are so many compromises taking place between the different Five Eyes signals intelligence groups
that they actually have lists that explain, "If you see this back door on the system, contact a friendly
agency. You've just recompromised the machine of another person.”

So when we talk about this, we have to consider that this is designed for at-scale exploitation. And
as far as I can tell it’s being used for at-scale exploitation. Which is not really in my mind a targeted
particularized type of thing, but rather it’s fishing operations. It’s fishing expeditions. It’s more like

fishing crusades, if you will. And in some cases, looking at the evidence, [MEI

So that said, that’s the internet, and we get all the way down to the bottom and we get to the Close
Access Operations and Off-Net, Off-Net and Close Access Operations are pretty scary things, but
basically this is what we would call a black bag job. That’s where these guys, they break into your
house, they put something in your computer and they take other things out of your computer.

Here's an example. First top secret document of the talk so far.
