They have some sort of a 3D Mode! of victims, whistleblowers,
whitehat hackers, Lab Rats, Verdingkinder apartment where
they can set eventtriggers (t14) or even create an atl out of
their victim. Generated from eg. RetinaCCD (eyel, a19,
Photogrammetry) or body telemetry (RFID in extremities) or an
older system like resonant cirquits. Maybe a persons position
could also be extrapolatet just from accustic data, for example
if you have more than 2 Laptops with microphone (see
IEEE1588) and a model of the apartment. They have also
access to my amygdala implant (b1) and at the same time
triggering cAPI (dt3) programmed in 2002 with something like
c12, t2, t7, t32 card. The Apartment was selected by Blums in
2002 (interactive, bidirectional, almost killed me). | guess they
are testing new systems, new socio-psychological design-
patterns, new Cyber-War equipment / patterns. They seem to
use Loops to "hide" things even police is affected: they did not
"saw" a laptop that was obvious on the table, they also "hide"
wound care material, and that is really bad.
