Inventor:
If you would have something like Neuralink or
US4877027 and Windows tells you, click here and a

, Or mouse gestures "if y

" [dx/dt | dy/dt] then a

chinese person you not know will die. You maybe
would not do this. But if soneone adds, "this should
technically not be possible" and is illegal, you
would need to test that to check that nobody else
goes into this trap. Maybe you really killed someone.
Since you don't know this person (german: kein
Motiv) and Windows was sold as kids-toy not as
Weapon you are maybe just the scapegoat. Maybe
people killed Muslims on Windows so the "Colateral
Murder" Video would revictimize 16Mio People for
drawing this damn V on Windows (m50 card).
