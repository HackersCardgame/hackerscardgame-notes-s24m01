Inductive reasoning is a method of reasoning n which the premises are viewed as supplying some evidence, but not full assurance, forthe trth of the conclusion! Its also described as a method
Where one's experiences and observations, including what are learned from others, are synthesized to come up with a general truth] Many dictionaries define inductive reasoning asthe derivation of
general principles from specific observations (arguing from specific to general), although there are many inductive arguments that do not have that form I

Inductive reasoning Is distinct from deductive reasoning, While the conclusion of a deductive argument is certain, the truth of the conclusion of an inductive argument is probable, based upon the
evidence given.
