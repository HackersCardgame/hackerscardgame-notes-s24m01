"some people are mortal", and "no people are mortal”, they are considered to be true, true, and false, respectively.

In mathematical logic, in particular in first-order logic, a quantifier achieves a similar task, operating on a mathematical formula rather than an English
sentence.

More precisely, a quantifier specifies the quantity of specimens in the domain of discourse that satisfy an open formula. The two most common formal
and "there exists some” (existential quantifier, "2").2ll4] For example, in

arithmetic, quantifiers allow one to say that the natural numbers go on forever, by writing that “for each natural number n, there exists some natural number m
that is bigger than n”; this can be written formally as "vneN. 3meN. m>n".§ The above English examples could be formalized as "vpeP. m(p)",!5l "3peP.
m(p)", and "= 3pP. m(p)",(7l respectively, when P denotes the set of all people, and m(p) denotes "p is mortal”. I:
