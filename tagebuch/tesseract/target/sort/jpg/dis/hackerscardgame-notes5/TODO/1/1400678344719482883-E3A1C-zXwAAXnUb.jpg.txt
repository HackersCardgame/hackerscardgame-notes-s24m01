So they use this metadata, they search through this
metadata retroactively, they do what’s called “tasking” - that
is, they find a set of selectors, so that’s a set of unique
identifiers - e-mail addresses, cookies, MAC addresses, IMEls,
whatever is useful. Voiceprints potentially, depending on the
system. And then they basically task those selectors for
specific activities.

So that ties together with some of the attacks which I'll talk
about, but essentially QUANTUMINSERTION and things that
are like QUANTUMINSERTION, they’re triggered as part of the
TURMOIL and TURBINE system and the QFIRE system, and
they’re all put together so that they can automate attacking
people based on the plain text traffic that transits the
internet or based on the source or destination IP addresses.

This is the second top secret document. This is an actual NSA
lolcat for the @]UANWRUITHEORY program.
