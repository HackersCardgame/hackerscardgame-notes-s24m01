Pre rendered
Destruction

Inventor:

They seem to know every cable in my local Network, and
they put some sort of traps (Eventtriger) on my
equipment to let me destroy as much of my equipment
as possible, sigh. Eg. making me pull the wrong plug,
making me stand on equipment. For example here they
showed me eg. on inner eye (tl... card) that this would
be the power cable that i , but in fact it
was the HDMI cable that was upside down in my screen
and broke the cable and even broke the HDMI Port on my
monitor. The " "would prevent me from
checking that, so the next time when i am in a hurry
would waste my time. It is very likely that they simply
could switch of devices by remote, but if they would do it
would rise questions.

irself, hahaha
One would need something
like SolidWorks or AutoCAD for this sort of attacks
