Fill-guns are sold as a Ring on a chain, for Seluale in
", In fact would be a black box
on fill-
gun. (Hopefully one has implemented an enhanced delete
function) If you eit fill- -gun into a Radio (SE235, or t25 /
t26?) with f 1 ig the Cryptological Keys are
loaded and radio would join to Military Network.
Frequency hopping would allow to tranmit to golc res
(e4) in the body. Main question would be, if the fill-
gun loads a radio, where are the fill-gun loaded.
Afaik Urs B. told me once that the Zurich Insuranse has
two specially secured terminals. Male Lobsters (biol)
thend to show off with e to compensate
their low self-esteem, in Bi√©re an officier also showed off
his Fill-Gun . | / We guess that the Fill-Guns gives
the owner access to all owned soldiers.
