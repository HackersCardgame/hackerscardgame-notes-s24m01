See Rowhammer Attack the Computer variant.
Similar to that concept one can do some sort of an
attack on the mind (eg tl card). Question an
innocent victim if he / she wants to commit suicide,
maybe with different ways of questioning that all
means the same main question

if you do this long enough this thought would be
burnt into his / her mind and maybe then cause a
real suicide (attempt).

maybe in conjunction with col, m38 cards
