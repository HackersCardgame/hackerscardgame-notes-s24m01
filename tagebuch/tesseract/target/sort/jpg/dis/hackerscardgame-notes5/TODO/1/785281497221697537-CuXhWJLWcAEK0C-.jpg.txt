SEARCHING FOR THE
MISSING TRILLIONS

On September 10, 2001 — the day before 9/11 — then-Secretary of
Defense Donald Rumsfeld held a press conference and announced
that $2.3 trillion was missing from the Pentagon budget. The missile
that struck the Pentagon the next day, 9/11, then destroyed the Naval

intelligence unit that was investigating what happened to this vast
sum. Presidents Bush and Obama failed subsequently to inform the
American people what happened to these funds. This was real
money — $2.3 trillion is $2,300,000,000,000. The President should
launch a search for this money that belongs to the American people.
