Inventor: xxxxx Year: 1910?

Frequent double archetype in US Movies: married couple,
who live a life in luxury financed with robbery and
murder, sometimes including drug abuse. Often
described as an "idyllic" partnership. These archetypes
seem to be protected by some NSA/CIA malware because
they also use them as _ startegic chess figure /
combination in an occupation areay. (Ab)using the "family
is the basic unit of our society ..." from the human rights
shameless and the children of the couple suffer and have
to pay the bill. Beeing protected by a system as big as
the CIA means, that they will become ignorant and part of
the problem. Worst case they have masked as a judge
and hangmen, worst worst case raping their kids after
they judged them with a wrong accusation. There are
cases where one of both plays mos5, so that at least one
of booth would not get sentenced.
