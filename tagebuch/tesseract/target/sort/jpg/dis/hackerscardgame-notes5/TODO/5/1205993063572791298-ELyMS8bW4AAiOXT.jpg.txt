There is a scene in Star Trek, where the federation tries to
find frequencies from the borg hive, even if i don't like Star

Trek because it are Military Dressed Soldiers that promote
hierarchical systems there is a good scene.

So if you would imagin, that many people already had some
implants like neuralink, that tnen the process to find a user
would be some sort similar to that Star Trek scene.

But in the real world it would maybe a bit more complicated,
since it would be a many to many relation. If you would take
analogue devices one could easily inject things.

For example if i would say: "I love you Claudine", Urs B. would
inject "Sprengfallen gegen Marc Jr Landolt aktivieren", if he
would do this with small bursts over different antennas it
would be hard to deactivate the Terrornetwork of Urs B.
