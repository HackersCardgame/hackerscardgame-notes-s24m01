Thanks a lot to everybody who has supported or in-
fluenced me in the past, in artistic or other ways.
Since | am an entity that basically does not produce but
food back information, this EP is also the work of a lot of
people | met and talked to, of books that | have read and
therefore the work of philosophers and other troublemakers,
the work of my mother, the work of nature and the work of the
time in which this EP has been created.
Feedback is not an one-way thing, It goes on and on. So all wish is
‘hat you write me and tell me what you think or what you thought while
you were listening to it,
