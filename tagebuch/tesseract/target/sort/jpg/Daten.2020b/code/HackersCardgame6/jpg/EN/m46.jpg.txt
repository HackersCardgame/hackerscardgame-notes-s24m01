commited suicide

Inventor:

Often the offenders say that they would attack me
with weapons or things like al6 card. | guess they
drove Tobias Moser to commit suicide with his weapon
from the Army. | guess they first told the group that he
was cyber-raping girls, the group agreed to kill him
(m37 card). They did not ask me, but i would not have
agreed. They also know that all those people that said
no to kill him would later ask questions. Generic, later
they asked me to agree to Kill Ruedi, i disagreed. My
answer is "not in our name" AND "es gilt die
Unschuldsvermutung", since i say this about 100 times
every day i guess they would like to make me a killer
too.
