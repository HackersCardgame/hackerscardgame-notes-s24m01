A% down in the suntess refreat oF
ihe ptean

Sweet flowers are springing fe
mertal can see .

Se deep in my soul fhe prayer of
Gevolion

Uthesrd by the- world, rises silent
fg Thee,

. Moore

De nef stand at my grave and weep. .

1 am oot there. | de net sicep.

1 am 2- thousand winds that blow,

ft am the diamond glinis on snow.

1 am fhe sunlight on ripened grain,

tam the gentle avtvmo rain.

Whenâ€™ you awake in the mornings
hush.

i am The will upflinging rush

Of quiet birds in circling Might.

1 am the scoff starshine af aight

Do nol sand st ory grave and ory.
4 @m nor There. 1 did nol die,
