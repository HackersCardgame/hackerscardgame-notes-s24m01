Adams’ Equity Theory diagram - job motivation

Scales ‘calibrated’ and measured against
comparable references in the market place

What I put into my job: time, effort,
ability, loyalty, tolerance, flexibility,
integrity, commitment, reliability, heart
and soul, personal sacrifice, etc

What I get from my job: pay, bonus,
perks, benefits, security, recognition,
interest, development, reputation, praise,
responsibility, enjoyment, etc

People become demotivated, reduce input andor seek changefimprovement whenever they feel their
inputs are not being fairly rewarded, Fairness is based on perceived market norms.
