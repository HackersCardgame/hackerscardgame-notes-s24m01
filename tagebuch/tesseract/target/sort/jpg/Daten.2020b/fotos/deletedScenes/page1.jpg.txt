THEREMIN -
END OFALEGEND
“The Theremin is surrounded by intrigue
land legend and this was played upon a
‘great deal in the Channel 4 documentary,
presented shortly after Leon Theremin’s
‘death in 1994. However, the role of a tech
nical magazine like EPE is to demystify
such things and explain their operation.

Itis said that a lot has been discovered in
electronics when things go wrong and this
is very likely in the case of the Theremin,
singe the principle of the Theremin fre-
quently arises by accident in electronics as
‘form of instability

A classic case occurs in radios where
there is a loud whistle accompanying the
desited programme, If the tuning control
is adjusted. the whistle usually changes
pitch. Combining this with another com-
‘mon fault, hand capacitance effects, the
pitch will’ change if a hand is moved
towards the receiver.

Tis very likely that the old regenerative
wireless sets popular in the twenties which
were prone to these defects, inspired
Theremin to analyse and exploit the effect
to make a musical instrument. So there
is no real mystery, the Theremin is in
fact just a glorified audible capacitance
metet!

BASIC
OPERATION

The basis of all Theremins is two high
frequency oscillators, of almost identi-
cal frequency, normally operating from
‘O-2MHz to 2MHz. One oscillator is fixed
while the other is connected to a conductor
which forms a variable capacitor with the
player’s hand. As the hand is moved, a
‘minute change in capacitance occurs (in the
order of fractions of a picofarad (pF)

shifling the oscillator’s frequency by a
‘correspondingly small amount.

The oscillator outputs are then com-
bined in a mixer as shown in Fig. 1 10
produce a beat frequency as shown in
Fig.2. If the two original frequencies are
close enough together, the beat frequency
will be in the audio region.

Now here comes the clever bit: since the
‘original frequencies are in the radio fre-
‘quency (Ff) region, it only requires a very
Small percentage shift to make a large dif-
ference to the beat frequency, giving a sen-
sitive instrument with a wide pitch range.

The mixer output contains a lot of rf
and is just like an a.m. radio signal. This
then needs to be detected and filtered to
obtain a clean audio signal, If the.
content is not removed the audio output
amplifier may “overheat” and the signal
may be radiated by the output wires caus-
ing instability

ORIGINAL
THEREMINS

Original Theremins built by RCA in the
thirties were very large valve/Wooden instru-
ments with a vertical conductor for Pitch
and a horizontal loop for Volume. (Basic
Theremins, such as the one described here,
do not usually have a volume control con:
ductor) The RCA’s Volume control was
{Quite unusual since it had a negative control
‘characteristic, in that no tone was emitted
Until the hand was removed.

‘Since voltage controlled amplifiers were
not effective at that time, the unique solu-
tion of varying the brightness of a di-
rectly heated valve filament was used. This
flament was fed wih cf generated by an
oscillator that could be damped via the
control conductor.
