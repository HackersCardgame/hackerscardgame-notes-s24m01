Fig. 1â€”There are two types of negative resistance and, though each
is characterized by a region of negative slope on its current-
voltage characteristic curve, their actions in a circuit are quite
different. One type is the dual of the other, and performance is
determined by response beyond this negative region. (a) The
negative resistance is observed here as a decrease in current for
an increase in voltage and in (b) it is observed as a decrease
in yoltage for an increase in current,
