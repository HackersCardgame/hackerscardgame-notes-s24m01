Figure 3. In a prior study, Freeman et al (2008) found that averaging together across half of trajectories
moving straight to the correct response (control trials) and half of trajectories making discrete-like errors
(switch trials) spuriously produces continuous attraction. As is shown in the histogram, the distribution of
AUC values in this combination condition including switch and contro! trials was bimodal (b > 585). This
validated that the mouse-tracking paradigm and computation of the b coefficient are sensitive enough to
identify this spurious pattern. From “Will a Category Cue Attract You? Motor Output Reveals Dynamic
