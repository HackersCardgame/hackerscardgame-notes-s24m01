VENTURE CAPITALISM

You have two cows.

You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using
letters of credit opened by your brother-in-law at the bank,
then execute a debt/equity swap with an associated general
offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax exemption
for five cows.

The milk rights of the six cows are transferred via an interme-
diary to a Cayman Island Company secretly owned by the
majority shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows
back to your listed company.

The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with
an option on one more.
