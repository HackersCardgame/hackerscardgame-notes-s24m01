Neuroscience:

Your brain can ean create false memories. This
is called False Memory Syndrome where you
can easily be fooled into remembering something
that isnâ€™t 100% true. In this condition, the person's
identity and relationships are affected because
they strongly believe in memories that are
factually incorrect.
