That's not all she has, though: a few hours within giving birth,

she came across these newly hatched ducklings. Her mother

instinct kicked in, and she brought them along and started to
nurture them.

If she had come across them a few hours before or after giving
birth, her hormone level might not be the same and she would
have eaten them.

It's amazing to see them draw milk from her, and one can only
guess that this is an instinct from the ducks, as they have come
across an unusual source for nutrition and just learned from the

kittens.

As the ducks grow older, they start to behave more like ducks
and less like kittens. This includes constantly walking away from
the box....

They have no problem keeping in line though, and even though
they grow a lot faster than their "siblings" they loyally follow
their mom around the farm, as ducks do.
