ste el fin del mundo

\Very strange event is happening in Mexico where thousands of
birds are gathering in the streets, a strange phenomenon previously
unseen by the locals.

According to studies, most of the birds can actually sense changes
in Earths electromagnetic field, which can be the reason as why the
birds have flock to the streets, but it’s usually not a good sign.

Whatever the reason may be, itis clear that these creatures have a
remarkable ability to detect upcoming disasters before humans do

The real question is where did they fly away from?
