But, yeah. Back here in reality, that to me is a really scary thing, especially
because one of the ways that they are able to have this capability, as |
mentioned, is these diodes. So what that suggests is that they actually
repurpose other people’s machines in order to reposition and to gain a
capability inside of an area where they actually have no legitimacy inside
of that area. That to me suggests it is not only heavy-handed, that they
have probably some tools to do that. You see where I’m going with this.

Well, QUANTUMINSERTION, this is also an important point, because this
is what was used against E@eEteea, this is what’s used by a whole
number of unfortunately players in the game where basically what they do
is they inject a packet. So you have a TCP connection, Alice wants to talk
to Bob, and for some reason Alice and Bob have not heard about TLS.
Alice sends an HTTP request to Bob. Bob is Yahoo. NSA loves Yahoo.
And basically they inject a packet which will get to Alice before Yahoo is
able to respond, right? And the thing is that if that was a TLS connection,
the man-on-the-side attack would not succeed. That's really key. If they
were using TLS, the man-on-the-side attack could at best, as far as we
understand it at the moment, they could tear down the TLS session but
they couldn't actually actively inject. So that's a man-on-the-side attack.
