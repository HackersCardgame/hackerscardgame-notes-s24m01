running it. Before we get to that, let's get more precise about what tokens are

Lexemes and Tokens 42

Here's a line of Lox code:

Here, var is the keyword for declaring a variable. That three-character
sequence "v-a-r" means something. But if we yank three letters out of the
middle of 1s like “g-u-0, those don't mean anything on their own

‘That's what lexical analysis is about. Our job is to scan through the list of
characters and group them together into the smallest sequences that still
represent something, Each of these blobs of characters is called a lexeme. In
that example line of code, the lexemes are

Cenaveee] E] i)

The exemes are only the raw substrings ofthe source code. However, in the

process of grouping character sequences into lexemes, we also stumble upon
some other useful information. When we take the lexeme and bundle it together
with that other data, the result isa token, It includes useful stuff ik:

Token type

Keywords are part of the shape ofthe language's grammar, so the parser often
hhas code like, “Ifthe next token is wht Le then do..." That means the parser
‘wants to know not ust that it has alexeme for some identifier, but that it has a
reserved word, and whick keyword itis,

The parser could categorize tokens from the raw lexeme by comparing the Alte al string comparison ends up looking

strings but tats slow and kind of uly Instead, atthe point that we recognizes indviual characters an tha the

lexeme, we also remember which kind of lexeme it represents. We have a
