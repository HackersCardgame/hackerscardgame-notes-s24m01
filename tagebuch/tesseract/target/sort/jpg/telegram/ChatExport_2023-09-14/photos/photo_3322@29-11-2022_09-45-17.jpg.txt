One of the most wicked destructive forces,
psychologically speaking, is unused creative
power... lf someone has a creative gift and
out of laziness, or for some other reason,
doesn't use it, the psychic energy turns to
sheer poison. That's why we often diagnose
neuroses and psychotic diseases as not-lived
higher possibilities.
