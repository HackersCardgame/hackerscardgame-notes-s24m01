Role/Archetype
The Voodoo-Lady is the Role (maybe without

even knowing it) that helps to obfuscate the
technology-cards. Many people think magic
works but don't beleive in things like
Stimoceiver, Active Denial System,

This archetype does not only appear in
Monkey Island" but also in "Pirates of the
Caribbean or in the Series Bones "The Man
in the Morgue” S1E19, but Bones picks in his
eyes and says: “If you picked someone in his
eyes, voodoo isn't that spooky anymore
