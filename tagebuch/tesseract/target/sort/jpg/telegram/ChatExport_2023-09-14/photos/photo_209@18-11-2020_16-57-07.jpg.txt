2005 ). The investigators argued that the lack of progress might be attributed to the nosological switch from the broader
schizophrenia concept in DSM-II to a narrowly de fi ned chronic schizophrenia in DSM-III, as well as the in fl uence of Berkson â€˜ s
bias.

Inclusiveness of diagnostic criteria appears to be a signi fi cant confounder in studies of predictors for out- come, such as in the
case of the higher male/female ratio in patients with an unfavourable outcome as a function of more restrictive diagnostic systems
(Castle et al.

1993 ). Similarly, enriched samples of poor outcome spuriously fi nd a more co-occurrence of positive and negative symptom
domains, thus creat- ing a false conception of a distinct illness, when in fact an in fl ated rate of concurrence has been the
individual contribution of each dimension to help-seeking behav- iour (Maric et al.

2004 ).

Meta-analyses report that male sex is associated with a 1.3 - 1.5-fold increase in the risk of developing schizo- phrenia (Aleman et
al.

2003 ; McGrath et al.

2004 ).

2003 ) ~ apparently as a result of the use of more stringent diagnostic criteria (Lewine et al.
1984 ; Castle et al.

1993 ; Beauchamp & Gagnon, 2004 ). Conversely, no statistically signi fi cant sex difference exists in preva- lence estimates of
schizophrenia (Saha et al.

2005 ; Perala et al.

2007 ). Aside from methodological issues (Saha et al.

2008 ), the ebb of male preponderance in prevalence estimates, contrasting with comparable incidence rates, could be interpreted
with two proposi- tions: (i) Male sex predicts both development of schizo- phrenia and either better outcome or greater illness-
related mortality during the course. However, evidence indicates no sex-difference in standardized mortality ratios (Saha et al
2007 ) and better outcome in women diagnosed with schizophrenia (Abel et al.

2010 ). (ji) Clinicians, guided by diagnostic manuals with rigid criteria, erroneously tend to overdiagni
first contact. With this dis- cussion, our aim was not to disentangle this paradox but to prompt resea
