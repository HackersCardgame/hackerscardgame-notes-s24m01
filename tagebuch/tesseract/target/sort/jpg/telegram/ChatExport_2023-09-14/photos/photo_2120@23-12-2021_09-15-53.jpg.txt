HackersCardgame (v 2.0.3)

Normal Tarot lacks Technology, Method and Algorithm Cards. HackersCardgame are
less Tarot Cards with magical power but more cards to learn & teach & explain
people one can do with modern technology today.

You should not play any card of normal tarot nor HackersCardgame. For example if
you would play "The Tower" from a normal Tarot,
. This would mean that you

then are a murderer and responsible for the death of two innocent people.

Today this would be logged in NSA/CIA DataRetention and of course also in other
BigData Systems and you would then be blackmailed with that murderer the rest of
your live. If you though play remember always to also play the Reversibility Card so
in case something goes wrong nobody dies, which technically would mean that a
medic is around the person you attack.
