Protect younger people [eit]

One important thing is missing in Hacker Ethics: whatever you do, always protect younger people, no matter what religion, no matter what
race, no matter what skin color, no matter if right wing, middle wing or right wing, no matter if male, female, non-binary, no matter if Little
Pony or Baby Dragon. One can morally hardly do something wrong if protecting younger people, and it would also be a mindset that would
find global acceptance and would lead to global coexistence. Protecting does not mean, that you later are allowed to take their goods or
their virginity, just because you helped. If you live that Categorical Imperative in an altruistic way it would give you meaing in your live.
