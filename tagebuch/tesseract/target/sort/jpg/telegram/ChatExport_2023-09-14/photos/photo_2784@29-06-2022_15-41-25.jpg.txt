the fish of the sea and over the
birds of the heavens and over the
livestock and over all the earth
and over every creeping thing
that creeps on the earth.”

Genesis 126

“Bvery atom in your body came from a
star that exploded. And, the atoms in
your left hand probably came from a
different star than your right hand. It
really is the most poetic thing I know

about physics: You are all stardust. You

couldn't be here if stars hadn't
exploded, because the elements - the
carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the
things that matter for evolution and for
life enough to explode.”
Lawrence M. Krauss - Physicist & Cosmologist
