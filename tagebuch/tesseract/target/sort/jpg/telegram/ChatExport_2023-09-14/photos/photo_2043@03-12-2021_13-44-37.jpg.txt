FailDev Is anyone good at math / calculations / #LawFare?

FalDev Claim: These types of judges trigger #environmental, #CO2 & other #resource problems?

FaiDev

FailDev Premise:

FailDev These types of judges are in a military system of compulsory measures because they take the first of eq four milion, and such a
company has tobe rebuit, which cost in each iteration the same amount of resources that was needed for the first one; after
the company n-1 had been sunken the preduction-goods have been spit into many parts and therefor can no longer solve the
‘company’s job.

FelDev Notes, approximate derivation of the train of thought after 24 hours of no sleep
