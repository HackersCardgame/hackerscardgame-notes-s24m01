QUEtiapine 2 cannabidiol
Applies to: Seroquel (quetiapine), cannabidiol

Using QUEtiapine together with cannabidiol may increase side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness,
confusion, and difficulty concentrating. Some people, especially the elderly, may also experience
impairment in thinking, judgment, and motor coordination. You should avoid or limit the use of alcohol
while being treated with these medications. Also avoid activities requiring mental alertness such as
driving or operating hazardous machinery until you know how the medications affect you. Talk to your
doctor if you have any questions or concerns. It is important to tell your doctor about all other
medications you use, including vitamins and herbs. Do not stop using any medications without first

talking to your doctor.
