Elon Musk says “we dont have enough bandwith to the
brain” but if you look at research like “micro needie
array" then you would see, that one could create massive
parralel interface to the brain. We guess the design of
Elon Musk's interface is completely bad and that he even
knows that. That what Elon Musk shows In his shows
about the Neuralink would just be some sort of
Neuronexus Product that he possibly did not even
develop himself. it would be very likely that Elon has
already such an implant and is now producing a low-tec
interface that would act as honey pot. We will send this
card to elon with the hashtag #Neuralink but we don’t
think that he will answer, maybe even filtered or he is
beeing blackmailed by eg. the CIA
