In this now moment as you breathe
into your body more deeply you can
just feel the trigger, feel the physical
disease even, feel the anger, feel the
sadness, feel the confusion... and
then instead of labeling it just BE
present with it. Sit with it. Listen to
it. Have its intelligence inform you. It
merely wanted to be heard.
