Description

Reads the value from the specified analog pin. Arduino boards contain a multichannel, 10-bit analog to digital converter.
VARIAB This means that it wil map input voltages between O and the operating voltage(SV or 3.34) Into integer values between 0
‘and 1023. On an Arduino UNO, for example, this yields a resolution between readings of: § volts 1024 units or, 0.0043
volts (4.9 mV) per unit. See the table below for the usable pins, operating voltage and maximum resolution for some
‘Arduino boards.

‘The input range can be changed using anal
MKR boards) using

The Arno Reference tnt On ATmega based boards (UNO, Nano, Mini, Mega), It takes about 100 microseconds (0.0001 s) to read an analog input,
triton Sha so the maximum reading rate is about 10,000 times a second,
