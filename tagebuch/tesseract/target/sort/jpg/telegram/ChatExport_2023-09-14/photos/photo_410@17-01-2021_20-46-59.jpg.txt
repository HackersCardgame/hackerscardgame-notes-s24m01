very close to you, and let's say you'e visiting Yahoo, then the Yahoo packet will nat beat you. That is, they will not
beat the NSA or GCHA. So it’s a race condition. And so they basically are able to control this whole system and

then localize attacks in that process.

So that’s a pretty — pretty scary stuff, actually. And while itis a digital thing, | think it’s important to understand that
this is what Jefferson talked about when he talked about tyranny. This Is turnkey tyranny, and It's not that it's
‘coming, i's actually here. I's just merely a question about whether or not they'll use It in a way that we think is a
good way or not a good way.

One of the scariest parts about this is that for this system or these sets of systems to exist, we have been kept
vulnerable. So its the case that ifthe Chinese, if the Russians, if people here wish to build this system, there's
nothing that stops them. And in fact the NSA has in a literal sense retarded the process by which we would secure

So that said, that's the internet, and we get all the way down to the bottom and we get to the Close Access
Operations and Off-Net. Off-Net and Close Access Operations are pretty scary things, but basically this is what we
‘would call a black bag job. That's where these guys, they break into your house, they put something in your
‘computer and they take other things out of your computer.

Here’s an example. First top secret document of the talk so far.
