You're welcome.

You have no idea

(laughter)
But | just wanted to make sure that ifthere was any question about whether or not you are exempt

from needing to do something about ths, that that is dispelled

You see? Cellphone’s on, Great. So. Hey guys.
[laughter]

So, the MARINA system is a contact chaining system as well as a system that has data, and in this
case what we see is in fact reverse contact and forward contact graphing. So, any lawyers in the
audience? If there are American citizens in this database, is reverse targeting like this illegal?
Generally? Is it possible that that could be considered illegal?

Yeah, so, interesting. Ifit's called reverse contact instead of reverse targeting - yeah, exactly.

So, you'll also notice the, on the right-hand side, webcam photos. So, just in case you're wondering,
in this case this particular target, | suppose that he did not or she did not have a webcam. Good for
them. If not, you should follow the EFF’s advice and you should put a little sticker over your

and they try to show who you are among all of these different potential identifiers - if you have five
e-mail addresses, they would link them together - and then they try to find out who all your friends

You'll also note at the bottom here, logins and passwords. So they're also doing dragnet surveillance
in which they extract - the feature set extraction where they know semantically what a login and a

password is in a particular protocol. And in this case this guy is lucky, | suppose, and they were not

able to get passwords or webcam, but you'll note that they were able to get his contacts and they

were able to see in fact 29, give or take, received messages as well, of which there are these things.

Now in this case we have redacted the e-mail and instant messager information, but this is an

example of how (laughs) you can’t hide from these things, and thinking that they won't find you is a
