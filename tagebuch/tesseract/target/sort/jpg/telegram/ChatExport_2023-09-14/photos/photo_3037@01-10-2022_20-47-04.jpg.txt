If you can do this on your own and go deeper and
deeper each time knowing that your energy and
experience are infinite... you will transform your
subconscious trauma patterns.

If you need a guide | have that free 12-min somatic
practice linkin bio. &

Then if you need more guidance you can download
my full guided somatic meditation album or join one
of my programs.

But honestly if you can commit to just this... this is all
you need. Save your money.
