HEALERS.

2 he
Healers are not perfect. They are actually far
from it. Healers are people who have stared
into the face of pain and suffering, and found
themselves staring right back. They create
themselves though all of the adversity, and in
the process, inspire others to do the same.
Healers do not necessarily have to heal
others. They heal themselves, and inspire
others to do the exact same.
