How much transmission power is required to induce 50mV toa golden wire that is2emlong [4
and hasa diameter of O:mm at 30GHz

To calculate the transmission power required to induce a specific voltage inawire,weneed CO) ©
to consider the wire's resistance, length, and the desired voltage. However, the wire's

dimensions and material alone are not sufficient to determine its resistance at a given

frequency. More information about the wire's resistivity is needed.

The resistivity of gold is typically around 2.44 x 10*-8 ohm-meters at room temperature.
However, the resistivity may vary with temperature and other factors. To proceed with the
calculation, we will assume a resistivity of 2.44 x 10*-8 ohm-meters.

First, let's calculate the wire's cross-sectional area:

Area

* (diameter/2°2
-m* (imm/2)'2

3147 (0.05mm)"2
814* 6x10" 5m)"2
814*25x10"-9m"2
785x109 m*D

Next, let's calculate the wire's resistance using the resistivity and length:

Resistance = (resistivity * length) / area
(2.44 x 10-8 ohm-meters * 0.02 m) /(785 x 10-9 m"2)
(488 x10™40 ohm-m)/ (7.85 x 10*-9 m"2)

6.22% 10-2 ohms

To induce a voltage of SOmV across the wire, we can use Ohm's law:

IR

Where Vis the voltage, | is the current, and Ris the resistance. Rearranging the formula, we
get

Regenerate

2 x 10°-2 ohms
