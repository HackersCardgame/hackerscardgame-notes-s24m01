Abstract

“Brainjacking’ refers to the exercise of unauthorized control of another's electronic brain implant.

Whilst the possibility of hacking a Brain-Computer Interface (BC!) has already been proven in both y) e 9)
experimental and real-life settings, there is reason to believe that it will soon be possible to interfere

with the software settings of the Implanted Pulse Generators (IPGs) that play a central role in Deep

Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems. Whilst brainjacking raises ethical concerns pertaining to privacy and ats
physical or psychological harm, we claim that the possibility of brainjacking DBS raises particularly

profound concerns about individual autonomy, since the possibility of hacking such devices raises the & FA aii.
prospect of third parties exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning the subject's

cognitive, emotional and motivational states. However, although it seems natural to assume that aia

brainjacking represents a profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest that the implications of
brainjacking for individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by
brainjacking often serve to enhance certain aspects of the user's autonomy. The difficulty of
ascertaining the implications of brainjacking DBS for individual autonomy is exacerbated by the varied
