The carnivorous lion symbolizes the Alpha Animal in a
(a)social-system. In Ecconomy these are often trend-
setters that make their followers buy things they don't
really need. They use the an satans global marketing
infratructure that unfortunately also kills innocent kids in
the 3rd world but als eg. in switzerland a you see on
card m46. Beeing in your circle of equal aged people is
normally much more satisfying but the infrastructure
tries to split them with eg.

sk1 && b1, co6, co7, m37 -> m46 -> dtl....

Maybe useful as bad example or as carpet, (note,
hopefully this picture represents a faux fur lion, so no
animal had to die). The "master" lion seems to create
other lions as scapegotes but also to make them defend
him and his Hitler-Mental-Operating-System
