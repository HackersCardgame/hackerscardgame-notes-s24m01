Like all archetypes think about the option that there
are always good and bad people. (al4 card) so it
could also have some angle archetypes that do bad
things or that are beeing abused to do bad thins. To
derived the archetyp from a person from cloths, look
or beauty leads often to wrong results, but if you talk
to a person or if you really know a person it will be
very hard for the CIA Neuralink Software to make
you think that this specific Satan is a Saint. They are
getting better with the touring completeness to hide
a persons real character and motivation. but since
they use generic code, one single mistake well
expose the truth, so listen carefully. If they loose one
archetype code you will find a lot of them and
remember there are both sorts, good and bad (al14)
