did not want people to find out what
is going on. So they tried to find out early who is autistic
(for example a Been ing the and who is
buying an assembler < by the age of 14) and then
those people fipossialy” eres) in question gave the
parents of the autistic child intentionally false advice; said
them things like " "or

"| In fact the technical system they don't want

the other people are betrayed by that system the
"Architect" does not want the people talk about.
