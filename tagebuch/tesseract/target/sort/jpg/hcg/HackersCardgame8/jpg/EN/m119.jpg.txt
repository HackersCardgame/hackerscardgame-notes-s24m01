@ Borg Hive
v Frequency Scannin
(injection & bursts

Inventor: XXXXX Year: ~????
There is a scene in Star Trek, where the federation tries to find
frequencies of the borg hive, i don't like Star Trek because it are
Military Dressed Soldiers that promote hierarchical systems, but
this is a good scene. So if you would imagin, that many people
already had some implants like neuralink, that then the process
to find a user would be some sort similar to that Star Trek
scene. In real world it would maybe more complicated, since it
would be a many to many relation. Many sources, many sinks.
Simple domain model: If you would take analogue devices one
could listen or easily inject things. For example if i would say: "I
love you Claudine", Urs B. would inject "Sprengfallen gegen
Marc Jr aktivieren", if he would do this with small bursts,
different antennas it would be hard to deactivate that
Terrornetwork. A big Problem would also be, if the are backup
systems that are 99.99999% of the time silent, eg implemented
as Autonomous system (Software). Things concerning Tobias
Moser (m37) seems to be such a backup trigger: cAPI::Moser
loop{"Claudine betrayed you with moser" && t15...}
