WHY JULY 142

Mad Pride Day is usually observed in the month of July,
usually on or around July 14, which is Bastille Day. 2021
marks the 30th anniversary of psychiatric survivors using
Bastille Day to celebrate Mad Pride.

The tradition of using Bastille
Day as Mad Pride Day was
started in New York by the
Mental Patients Liberation
Alliance and has since spread
around the world. For over two
centuries, the storming of the
Bastille has been a universal
symbol of liberation. In addition,
when the Bastille was stormed,
detained prisoners with
psychiatric labels were freed.
