look at three last answers you gave me. ARE YOU TOLLING ME.

| apologize for the confusion. The third answer | provided is correct.
The first two answers were wrong because | did not enclose the
echo command in quotes.

Here is the code again:
for file in ; do

echo "$file"
done

This will iterate over all the files in the current directory and print
their names.
