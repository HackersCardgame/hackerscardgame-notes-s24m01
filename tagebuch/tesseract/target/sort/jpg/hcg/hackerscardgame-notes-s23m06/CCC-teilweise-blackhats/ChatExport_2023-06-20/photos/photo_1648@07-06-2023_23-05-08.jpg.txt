it is wrong that doesn't list the files

You are correct. The code | provided does not list the files. |
apologize for the mistake.

Here is a corrected version of the code that will list all the files in
the current directory:

for file in ; do
echo $file
done

This will iterate over all the files in the current directory and print
their names.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
