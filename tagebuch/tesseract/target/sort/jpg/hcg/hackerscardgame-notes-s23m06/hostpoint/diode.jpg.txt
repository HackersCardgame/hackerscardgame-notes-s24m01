exists another system that's called , and we revealed abou
system in the Spiegel publication today as well. So if TURMOIL is deep
packet inspection, then TURBINE is deep packet injection. And it is the
system that combined together with the things — with TURMOIL and
TURBINE you can create a platform which they have consolidated which
they call QFIRE. QFIRE is essentially a way to programmatically look at
things that flow across the internet that they see with TURMOIL and then
using TURBINE they’re able to actually inject packets to try to do attacks,
and I'll describe some of those attacks in detail in a moment.

But essentially the interesting thing about QFIRE also is that they have a
thing that’s called a fff. So if you have for example a large number of
systems where you control them, you might say, “Hey, what are you doing on
that backbone?” “Hey, what’s going on with these systems?” And they could
say, well, you know, we paid for access, we’re doing this, it’s all legal,
etcetera. QFIRE has this really neat little detail which is that they compromise
other people’s routers and then redirect through them so that they can beat
the speed of light.

And how they do that is that they have a passive sensor that’s nearby a thing
that they can inject from, and when they see that thing sees a selector that is
interesting to them or is doing a thing that they would like to tamper with in

some way. then they take a i
