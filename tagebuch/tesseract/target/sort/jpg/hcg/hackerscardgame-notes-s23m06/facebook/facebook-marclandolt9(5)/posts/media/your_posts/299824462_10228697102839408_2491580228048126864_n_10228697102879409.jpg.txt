Soon after the flight, the Soviet mint created an enamel pin to celebrate “The First
Passenger in Space.” Soviet allies, such as Romania, Albania, Poland and North Korea,

issued Laika stamps over the years between 1957 and 1987.

Laika was not the first space dog: Some had soared in the Soviet military's sub-orbital
rocket tests of updated German V-2 rockets after World War II, and they had returned to
Earth via parachuted craft—alive or dead. She also would not be the last dog to take
flight. Others returned from orbit alive. After the successful 1960 joint flight of Strelka

and Belka, Strelka later produced puppies, and Khrushchev gave one to President John F.
