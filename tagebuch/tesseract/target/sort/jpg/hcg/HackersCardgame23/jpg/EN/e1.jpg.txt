A vacuum tube or valve (Britain and some other
regions), is a device that controls electric current
between electrodes in an evacuated container.
Vacuum tubes mostly rely on thermionic emission of
electrons from a hot filament or a cathode heated by
the filament. This type is called a thermionic tube or
thermionic valve. Not all electronic circuit valves/
electron tubes are vacuum tubes (evacuated); gas-
filled tubes are similar devices containing a gas,
typically at low pressure

As a Transistor today used for high friquency and
high power amplifiers like radio stations
