The Peaceful Pill eHandbook

Internet Sources - Liquid Nembutal

There is currently only one known source of liquid Nembutal
operating on the open Internet. This source is known as B.

This supplier sells Pentobarbital (100m1@63mg/m1, ie. 6.3gm).
The cost seems to vary depending on destination, starting at
US$450 for one bottle to the US ($700 for 2 bottles), although
several Australians and at least one European have reportedly
paid US$1000 for 2 bottles. Payment is by Bitcoin or Monero
(XMR). —

Contact details for this source reportedly changed in November
2021. Their current email address is:
dsupplynbtl@protonmail.com

—————— SSS

Note: Exit notes that Source B (previously known as D)
previously used a CTemplar address and a different protonmail
address.

Note: Past reports to Exit say that this supplier asks for proof
of purchase of the PPeH as a safeguard against sale to minors.

Note: The supplier known as ‘AV’ has been removed from
the PPeH due to reported repeated failures to follow through.
Indeed, this supplier has been increasingly accused of scamming.

Note: Fake editions of The Peacefil Pill eHandbook continue
to be distributed on the Internet. These fake editions can contain
altered contact addresses.
