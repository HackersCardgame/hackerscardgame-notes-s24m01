To opress People with finances and existence fear.
The backend is possibly a massive  server-
infrastructure that has access to almost all financial
systems like SAP, Navision or Abacus, "possibly" all
owned by the NSA / CIA. It is in fact this can even be
abused as Weapon. But it maybe just obfuscates the
t27 card. So it would still be unknown why people
that run amok or suicide have been killed. Possibly
not even the highly praised Swiss Banks can secure
their Systems.

Can be used to understand the motivation of people
and make them to go the right way but also to
oppress people (which is unfortunately often the
normal use case)
