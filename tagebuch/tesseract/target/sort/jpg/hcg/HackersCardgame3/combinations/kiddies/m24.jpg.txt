Morality generally refers to the actual action
patterns, conventions, rules or principles of
individual individuals, groups or cultures. It would be
better to say norms, values, categorical imperatives,
which serve the general public as well as the
individual, the counterpart to egoism.

To keep the system stable and create sufficient
reserves, so that it does not break, if something
small goes wrong and / or become Sodom &
Gomorra (Hebrew ninyi o1D).
