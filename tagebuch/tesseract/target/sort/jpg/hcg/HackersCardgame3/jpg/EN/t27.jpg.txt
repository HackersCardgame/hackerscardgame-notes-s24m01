Fill-guns are sold as a Ring on a chain, for example i in
Tolkien’ s "Lord of the Rings". In fact would be a blac

gun. (Hopefully one e has implemente an enhanced delete
function) If you put fill-gun into a io (SE235,
or t25 / t26?) with frequency ho the Cryptological
Keys are loaded and radio would join to Military Network.
Frequency hopping would allow to tranmit to
(e4) in the body. Main question would be, if the fill-
gun loads a radio, where are the fill-gun loaded.
Afaik Urs B. told me once that the Zurich Insuranse has
two specially secured terminals. Male Lobsters (bio1)
thend to show off with to compensate
their low self-esteem, in Biére an officier also showed off
his Fill-Gun . | / We guess that the Fill-Guns gives
the owner access to all owned soldiers.
