n. accumben

The nucleus accumbens (NAc or NAcc), also known
as the accumbens nucleus, or formerly as the
nucleus accumbens septi (Latin for nucleus adjacent
to the septum) is a region in the basal forebrain
rostral to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus.

The nucleus accumbens plays a lesser role in
processing fear (a form of aversion), impulsivity, and
the placebo effect. It is involved in the encoding of
new motor programs as well.

Not sure if this text from en Wikipedia is correct,
having a medic for that would be great.
