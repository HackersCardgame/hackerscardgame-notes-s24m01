Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~????

With Weapon part 1 card they forced me to open my safe
deposit box at UBS Aarau (The Police Officers Name:
Michael R. & a Women dont remeber name) They photos
from the content of my deposit box, just as a "proof" that
there are no weapons in my deposit box. In fact this was
footprinting and ennumeration for to steal my data and to
create more suicide death bots against me and us. This
was granted possibly by prosecuting attorney Marco Spr. of
the Justizdepartement Aargau, Switzerland. So now Urs,
Martin, Astrid, Pfisterer and the whole Canton of Aargau
has all my data, and maybe they even used MY diary entry
about Michael B. (Grosimdrder Aarau) to drive (t* cards) to
him run Amok against his Grandmother. | was thinking
Michael B. will commit suicide so i meet often with him to
deescalate, but i could not when i was in the mentail
institution when Michael driven to run amok.
