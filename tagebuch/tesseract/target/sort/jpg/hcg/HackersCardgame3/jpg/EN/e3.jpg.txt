Tunnel /
ESAKI Diode

iaventor:

A tunnel diode or Esaki diode is a type of
semiconductor that is capable of very fast operation,
Operates in microwaveâ€™ frequencis. quantum
mechanical effect called tunneling.

Like an Electrone Tube, to create High Frequencies /
Oscilators. One could maybe integrate his also in
CPU's or other electronic components.
