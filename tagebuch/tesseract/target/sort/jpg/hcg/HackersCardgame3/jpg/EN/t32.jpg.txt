Like t10 or t23 a game engine (here Blender 3D) is also
some sort of t7 Card, but it's not just a loop it are more
event-triggers (t14) or state machines (col), for example
if | leak about this sort of things al6 card is beeing
activated against me. They often use an event in real live
to create this story, you would focus on the initial scene
and the person instead of technology. And possibly with
Al / Deep Learning (a11 card) prerendered Al or genetic
algorithm that learns. The card is in neutral gray, because
you could use such technology also for good things but in
my case they abused it more like weapon or "white"
torture against me. that wants to kill. Book Erebos. The
algorithm would maybe also try to isolate whistleblowers
and whitehats that could be as simple like an inverted
F=TVSr Card (Alex Wissner Gross) formula, not keeping
all people connected but isolate some or even all.
