You could maybe also use some similar concept like
rawhammer attack but on the mind (eg tl card).
Question an innocent victim if he / she wants to
commit suicide, if you do this long enough this
thought would be burnt into his / her mind and
maybe then cause a real suicide attempt. Never play
"red team" always play "blue team". This red team
action could maybe would kill a victim, and then
they would play dtl card (but then you are guilty)

maybe in conjunction with col card
