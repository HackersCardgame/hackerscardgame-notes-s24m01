Inventor: .00xx Year: ~????
The trunk of the elefant can be interpreted by other
children (that maybe wre abused by pedophile older
people) as phallic symbol, so the Rape would be
virtuallly revived again (revictimizing, maybe t1, t15,
b1 and other cards involved) and the victim would
then maybe hate the kid with Elephant Plush much
more, than the initial pedophile offender, depending
on the â€œexposure time" See Clark Hulls Formula for
Emotions. Maybe the reason why Stefan K. and
Stefan W. threw Marcs Plush-Elephant out of the
window from the 3rd floor in a christian camp when
Marc jr was about 14 Years old, but no details are
known so far about this cases since both don't want
to talk with Marc Jr. or it is censored on all
communication paths.
