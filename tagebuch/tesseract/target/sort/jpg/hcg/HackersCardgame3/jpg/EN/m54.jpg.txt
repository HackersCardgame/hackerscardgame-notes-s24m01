Cards used t1, t2, t10, t12 (of also showing content
in social media, mail, like the study where facebook
showed that they can influence mood customers
with only showing good or bad content)

It is used more complex too, if the last good scene
really stabilizes your mental state they mabe see
that with eeg, eg t1, t3, t4, activating things like dt1,
dt3 in conjunction with t15 or t19 and playing the
loop for the bad things to delete the one last scene
that stabilizes you. So you would become psychotic
again and they could make business with m49, ...
They seem to combine it EEG Fear detection (m57)
to automatically target whistleblowers, if they can
detect an earlier scene they trigger (t14) even more
similar Bad Scenes from earlier
