Speakers

Inventor: JVC Year: ~1970
Maybe directly built into the apartments walls, if
you would play a gun-shot sample (see card m21)
could drive the victim paranoid. Quadrophonic or
even Octophonic in building with multiple floors
would cause the mind to interpret the sounds as
authentic and make naighbours fight each other

Building ControlUnit with 1990 Technology:
2x Gravis Ultrasound Stereo

2x Sound_Blaster Stereo

4x LPT && JDAC / CENT_DAC (see t9 card)

For Therapy (a2 Card). But unfortunately also to
make people agressive to force them to fight against
each other :(
