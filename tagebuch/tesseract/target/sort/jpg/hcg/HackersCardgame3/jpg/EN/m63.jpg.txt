Lieber

das sieht aus wie Gaggi (Schweizerdeutsch), erzeugt somit
Vermeidungsverhalten beim Betrachter sich iber dies Cold War-era
intrusion detectros zu informieren, wir sind ja alle komplett bl√©d...

These Cold War-era intrusion detectors were designed to blend with
the terrain. They can detect movement up to 300 meters away, are
powered by tiny power cells, and have built-in antennae. Transmitters
relay data From the device via coded impulses

The CIA seems to put disgusting (igittttt) Pictures on
relevant informations (Cold War-era Intrusion detectors...
that can detect movement up to 300 meters)

This normally leads to avoidance to inform yourself about
what they inform the people who know and abuse this
dirthy trick.

And it would be likely that eg in the picture, in the EXIif
Data or in a system where only agents have access would
be less disgusting content but more informations.

(and it would also be likely that this tweet would dissapear
or would be changed... but you really don't want to click
that link)

And most likely the link would be a HoneyPot for the
good people.
