There are algorithms to find out about the language
evel of the person who wrote that text. For example
if the text was written by a second grade student or
by a language professor. It seems that satan took
this algorithm and used it as filter algorithm that
filters communication above a specific language
level. For example for filtering communication over
tl or tl12 card. This would have effect that especially
intelligent people would be handicaped in "unseen
university" (Terry Pratchett) while the less educated
people would have no problems to communicate
with each other. Unsure if bug or feature (preventing
m40 card). But in a fair world all or none should have
that filter. But it definitively wastes our time and
makes us crazy and low self-esteem...
