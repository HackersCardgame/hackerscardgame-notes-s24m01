Specific Events can trigger Actions, GPS Data, Data from
acceleration sensors in handies (for example specific
roller coaster) Events could be Sounds, turning on Light-
Switch (maybe evaluated by smartmeter and the a list of
what device uses how many watts), images, Automatic
Behavior Recognition, websites (urls), Buttions or Mouse
gestures on a computer, Handy or even if you draw a
circle with your hand in the air. One can racognize events
with Al (Pattern Recognition, Deep Learning...)

For Example if JUrg S. would have fired illegally with a
weapon, this event would have been recorded and caused
an event in a Gunfire locator system [1].
