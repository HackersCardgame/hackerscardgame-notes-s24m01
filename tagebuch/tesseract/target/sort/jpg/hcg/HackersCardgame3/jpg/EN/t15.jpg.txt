The Active Denial System roasts the top layer of the skin
at a distance of 500m. For a range of 5 m logically more
than 100 x smaller, small enough to fit in a cell phone.
Actually, 1930s electron tube technology, but today you
can do this also with semiconductors (Esaki-/Tunnel
diode). Maybe one could do the same thing directly in the
CPU with Army-Grade Crypto, since the radiation power
reduces to the square of the distance, it would be quite
small. The "Active Denial System" - denialer would thus be
the natural archnemesis of a TinFoil-hat

At a rangen of 500m one could terrorize lodger and if it
would have been coupeled with the victims computer and
there are additional some algorithms one could drive the
the victim insane, drive to commit suicide or make it even
run amok. See cars: t1, t10, t12, a16, atl, bl, el, e5,
