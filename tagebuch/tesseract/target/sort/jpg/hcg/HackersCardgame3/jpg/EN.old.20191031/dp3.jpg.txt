Design patterns are proven solution templates for
recurring design problems in architecture as well as
in software development.

A design pattern usually contains several classes
(templates or objects). A single design pattern is a
collection of different such templates. E.g. The shape
of a single step of stairs AND the railing (steelwork
or eg woodwork) for the complete stairs AND for
example the shape for the carpet of each step.
