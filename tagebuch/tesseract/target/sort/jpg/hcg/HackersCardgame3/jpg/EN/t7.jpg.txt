Inventor: Silas Warner Year: ~1981
Castle Wolfenstein (Muse Software) was maybe not the
first 3D Engine, but maybe it was the first enduser 3D
Engine. Like a SkinnerBOX (t2 Card) but "innocently"
sesame as pehiidren s toy that uses invasive (eg tl card)
or | 1 a ted t12, t8... Cards) technologies. Such
games can bea unidirectional or bidirectional (eg. b4 card).
Similar to a newark monitoring system possibly with
Plug-INs, which are partially not even accessable by the
user, or as a separate addon that just evaulates symbols
in the game (eyel card) or bigger things like Quantum
Inserts, Turbine, Tarmoil. Game, fun, therapy or "therapy",
game could also generate psychological profiles like Big5,
Mayer-Briggs or even MMPI2. For example i bought a
game, joined the server, saw the first enemy that had his
back to me but i could not shoot him as a vegetarian.
