To record and play sounds digitally. You can
change pitch, bass, trebles, snip single words and
glue them together like you want. It is also
possible to use other mathematical models, e.g.
Fourier analysis/transform to analyse the samples
or to modify them. Simplest variant, if you play
twice the same with delay of 0.2 seconds to
achieve an echo effect. See "Curve Discussion"
