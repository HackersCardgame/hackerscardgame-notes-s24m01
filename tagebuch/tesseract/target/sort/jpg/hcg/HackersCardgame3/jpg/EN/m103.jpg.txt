Sons have often problems with their fathers. Fathers often
bully their sons, they abuse them, torture them, attack them
(no matter if physically or verbally) After a while the son is
old enough to defend himself, the justice system is norally
not very interested in this things, but this causes the sons to
become evil, maybe learned this behavior from their father,
and are doing the same to younger people because they
learned that it is "legitimate" to do this. In some cases then
the father would punish the oldest son (sonl) even more
because he does the same to the younger son (son2), unsure
if just reason to punish a weaker like the chief does or
really wants to protect the youngest. (Bigger Domain Model:
Money beats m72 Card, m72 card beats unfortunately m24
card). maybe in conjunction with mos6 or mos2 card

This behavior (psychology: introjection) then would be the
normal case and would feed problems into the wohle social
systems (also m102 karte) and finally hits also daughters too
