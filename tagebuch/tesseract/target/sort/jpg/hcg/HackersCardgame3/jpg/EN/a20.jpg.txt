There are algorithms to find out about the language
level of the person who wrote that text. For example
if the text was written by a second grade student or
by a language professor. It seems that satan took
this algorithm and used it as filter algorithm that
filters communication above a specific language
level. For example for filtering communication over
tl or tl12 card. This would have effect that especially
intelligent people would be handicaped in â€œunseen
university" (Terry Pratchett) while the less educated
people would have no problems to communicate
with each other. Unsure if bug or feature (preventing
m40 card). But in a fair world all or none should have
that filter. But it definitively wastes our time and
makes us crazy and low self-esteem.
