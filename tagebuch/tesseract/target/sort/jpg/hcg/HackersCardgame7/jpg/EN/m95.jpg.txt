When i was 20 Years old 3 "friends" used peer pressure over
a period of 6 months to make me consume Ecstasy in our
Music Studio below a (stereotype) Gym. We also watched the
movie "The Matrix". In the end they succed. After that Scene
the tl card told me, that i now must "enlighten" also the
equal aged Girl Rahel Sc. (they wanted me to fork, so i would
have been guilty of ruining someones live too and then i
would not leak all this informations) but i did not want to and
i did not. Then the t1, t2, t6, t11... Cards also told me to put
some XTC into a bottle in my parents fridge, i did almost, but
i did not. | guess the suggestion they used was, that my
parents have a less technical / scientific background, so i
wanted to "enligthen" them as a gift. It was even the same
substance i already consumed, so i was not thinking about
that i could have poisonend them, but i possibly would.
