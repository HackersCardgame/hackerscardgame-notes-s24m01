If one would add a device to a webcam that can cause lot
of PAIN (for example with sound above 120dB or with an
implant or Active Denial System) one would not see the
cam anymore after a while. This would be some sort of
Skinner Box or classical condtioning (t2, t11) and maybe
cards t10, t14, t15, t32, t33, m38, m26, endol, el, e2,
e3, e4, Involved. The cam would become invisible for the
poor LabRat. Maybe you could hide even specific images
shown on your computer. So this would maybe the real
reason why Pinky & Brain never wins. If you feel PAIN
since 17 years one could begin to ignore that there are
invisible things. This (i guess i'm a bit Autistic) would be
an invitation to hack this sort of technology. And since |
would be the LabRat it would be a selfe-experiment and
therefor hacking that would be a lawful / legitime move.
