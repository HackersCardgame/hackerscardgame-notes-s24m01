about that have been made public, about how the structure of the URLs
are laid out and so on. An important detail is that they pretend that they’re
Apache, but they actually do a really bad job. So they’re like Hacking
Team, maybe it’s the same guys, | doubt it though, the NSA wouldn’t slum
with scumbags like that, but. Basically you can tell, you can find them,
because they aren’t really Apache servers. They pretend to be something
else.

The other thing is that none of their infrastructure is in the United States.
So, real quick anonymity question. You have a set of things and you know
that a particular attacker FWemeoueekioumenemaleies. Every country on
the planet potentially, but never one place. The one place where most of
the internet is. What does that tell you in terms of anonymity? It tells you
usually that they’re hiding something about that one place. Maybe there’s
a legal requirement for this. It’s not clear to me. But what is totally clear to
me is that if you see this type of infrastructure and it is not in the United
States, there is a chance, especially today, that it’s the NSA’s Tailored
Access and Operations division.

And here’s an important point. When the NSA can’t do it, they bring in
GCHQ.
