If you are younger than 40 feel FREE TO SAY AS
MANY WRONG THINGS as you Like. It's not up

to you, to teach or to fix people that are older than
you how they could have done things better, but do it
better yourself and give this card also to the younger
generations and don't make the younger generations
clean up your mess like the 1950s Generation did to
us:https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonderm%C3%

Use Cases

If an older Person gives you a bad feeling, if you
said something wrong, it's not worth it to invest your
time into his "lessons". often the teacher (Sophist
opposite of a philosopher) just compensates his own
self-esteem at the expense of his students...
