“cove and compassion are necessities, not (uxuries|

Without them humanity cannot survive.”

Dalai Lama

Inventor:

, or more some few people in big
systems like’ the or
mostly older people tend to separate society eg.
left-wing from right-wing or christianity from islam
from judaism, white from black, ... they try to make
them fight each other while those who made them
fight take their goods. Maybe we should warn the
younger people with the message: COEXIST. As a
Christian for example learned a lot from Islamic or
jewish culture. Notice: for many people today
science or atheism is also some sort of religion
even if it's called atheism. Those people

would maybe want to distroy this

card so that they can play on thier dirthy game. |
please all religions to distribute and protect this
sort of COEXIST cards. This Card would help to
mitigate the "Divide Et Impera" on the flags of
some StudentAssociacions

* Access to computers—and anything which might teach you
something about the way the world works—should be
unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On
Imperative!

* All information should be free

* Mistrust authority—promote decentralization

* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria
such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position

* You can create art and beauty on a computer

* Computers can change your life for the better

Role/Archetype

Guybrush Threepwood had the role of the hero
In the Lucas Arts game Monkey Island™

In classic tarot he would be “The Fool"-
Card, actually too stupid to save the world,
but has non-normal-distributed luck and his
childish behavior gives him high values in
the mayer-briggs dimension “agreeableness*
which would be perfect as a chessfigure
would of satan, admiting Guybrush is stupid
not telling that he can use him.

But ignore him, focus on the technology
cards that produces real three-headed-
terrorist-monkey!

CUDDLY TOYS
FIXATIONY

Inventor:

To hug, to cuddle, clinical use e.g. in the case of
children that have been sexually abused to
recognize (object fixation on the plush / coping
strategy, “clinging to the plush") when the victim is
overstrained with the examination => pause!

Multifunctional:to hug, to throw at the head of other
people, coping strategy of kids if parents don't care
enough about the children, or as a present to show
solidarity: s :

Inventor:

Brilliant didactical model to teach conflict solving
strategies to children and adolescents. The goal

of the game is world peace.

Hacker Terminals
“i "Cy ei) |(Micredot)

Inventor:

‘At some Congresses there is the famous talk "Hacker
Jeopardy", and sometimes there is a Section
(vintage) Hacker Terminals", In my opinion this
Section should also include devices (such as
children's toys), because e.g. the DBS (t40,t41 Card)
seems to have a function to “call home" and the first
time i saw this Concept Knowledge was in the movie
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial in 1982. Such film scenes
are 1 for the " " (mostly closed
source) to inform Parents about features of their
gear. The children would be put on another DBS
stream / content and then think,
