Google earth combines satellite images, aerial photography and map data to create
3D interactive template of the world. This template can be used by anyone to add
and share information about any subject that involves geographical elements. Nature
(international weekly journal of science) uses Google earth to track the spread of the
HSNI avian flu virus around the globe, and to present a geographic visualization of
the spread of HSNI [19] (Nature website).
