COBOL programmers, programs are being migrated to new platforms, rewritten in modern
languages or replaced with software packages. [8] Most programming in COBOL is now purely to
maintain existing applications; however, many large financial institutions were still developing
new systems in COBOL in 2006 due to the mainframe processing speed.|°]

COBOL was designed in 1959 by CODASYL and was partly based on the programming
language FLOW-MATIC designed by Grace Hopper. It was created as part of a US Department
of Defense effort to create a portable programming language for data processing. It was originally
