installation of
irrelevant information

inventor XXXXX Year: ~????
IMHO there is a nightly (maybe global [generic|personalized])
algorithm on the Network / Mainframe, that installs irrelevant
or false information to your brain. Or it primes (Priming
[psychology]) you to buy crap you don't need. The next day
this installed information is recalled and makes you buy
spontaneous crap you don't need.

Prerequisites:

- (Global)

The Psyche of 1980s+ people normally survive withtout all
