which might be your home router potentially, and then that home router decapsulates that packet and sends fishing wilavx
it out. And because that is very close to you, and let’s say you're visiting Yahoo, then the Yahoo packet will

not beat you. That is, they will not beat the NSA or GCHQ. So it’s a race condition. And so they basically are

able to control this whole system and then localize attacks in that process.

So that’s a pretty — pretty scary stuff, actually. And while it is a digital thing, | think it’s important to

understand that this is what Jefferson talked about when he talked about tyranny. This is turnkey tyranny, Z
and it’s not that it’s coming, it’s actually here. It’s just merely a question about whether or not they'll use it in

a way that we think is a good way or not a good way.

One of the scariest parts about this is that for this system or these sets of systems to exist, we have been
kept vulnerable. So it is the case that if the Chinese, if the Russians, if people here wish to build this system,
there’s nothing that stops them. And in fact the NSA has in a literal sense retarded the process by which we
would secure the internet because it establishes a hegemony of power, their power in secret to do these
things. And in fact I’ve seen evidence that shows that there are so many compromises taking place between
the different Five Eyes signals intelligence groups that they actually have lists that explain, “If you see this
back door on the system, contact a friendly agency. You’ve just recompromised the machine of another
person.”

So when we talk about this, we have to consider that this is designed for at-scale exploitation. And as far as |
can tell it’s being used for at-scale exploitation. Which is not really in my mind a targeted particularized type
of thing, but rather it’s fi8hing operations. It’s fishing expeditions. It's more like fishing crusades, if you will.
And in some cases, looking at the evidence, that seems to be what it is. Targeting Muslims, | might add,
because that’s what they’re interested in doing.

So that said, that’s the internet, and we get all the way down to the bottom and we get to the Close Access
Operations and Off-Net. Off-Net and Close Access Operations are pretty scary things, but basically this is
what we would call a black bag job. That’s where these guys, they break into your house, they put something
in your computer and they take other things out of your computer.

Here’s an example. First top secret document of the talk so far.
