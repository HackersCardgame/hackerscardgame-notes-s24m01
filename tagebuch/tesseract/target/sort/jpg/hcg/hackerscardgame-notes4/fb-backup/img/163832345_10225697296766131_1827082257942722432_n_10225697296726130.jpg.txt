e/coronavirus-julian-assange-to-make-bail-application-over-v 2

Julian Ass:

Julian Assange will apply for bail on Wednesday because of concerns he is vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic in
prison, his lawyers said.

The WikiLeaks founder is being held at London's Belmarsh prison, while he is fighting extradition to the US on hacking
and espionage charges.

His extradition trial began in February and was adjourned until May but could be delayed further.

" campaign group Don't Extradite Assange said.

Mr Assange faces up to 175 years in a US prison over the 2010 release of hundreds of thousands of top-secret military
documents and diplomatic cables on his whistle-blowing site.

The Australian national has been in Belmarsh since he was arrested in the Ecuadorian embassy last year where he had
been holed up since 2012.

READMORE = ~~~—~He sought asylum after skipping bail following his arrest in 2010 as Swedish
prosecutors sought to question him over rape and sexual assault claims against two
women. The case was finally dropped three months ago because of the time it had
taken to bring any potential case to court.

The bail application comes after a warning by the head of the Prison Governors
Association that inmates could die of Covid-19.
