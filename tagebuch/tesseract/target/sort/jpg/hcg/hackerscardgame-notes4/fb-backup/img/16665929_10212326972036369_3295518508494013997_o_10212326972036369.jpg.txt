German: Sugar not Carrot. The brain tells the
"child", you have to eat that again (because
sugar has a lot of energy) so you want more
sugar/carrots. Unfortunately, it is also
possible, to use the carrot to lead the child
into the wrong direction: for example, if
someone would reward it, if one tears the little
sister at her hairs, this would be programmed
too. Parents who would do such crap, would deny
the existence of Behavioral "Sciences"...

Use Cases
In every sweets store, every kiosk, every corner there
are sugar-armed salesmen that argue, that they are
Zacchaeus, chief tax-farmer and would claim that
they are entitled take the money for carrots.
