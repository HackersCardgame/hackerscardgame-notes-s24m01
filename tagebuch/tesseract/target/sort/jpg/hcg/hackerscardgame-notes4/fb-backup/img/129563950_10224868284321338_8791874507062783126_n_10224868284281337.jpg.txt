So this is important, because members of the U.S. Congress, they have no clue about these things. Literally, in
the case of the technology. Ask a Congressman about TCP/IP. Forget it. You can't even get a meeting with them.

they don't have a clue, and another part of it is because they can't talk about it because they don't have a
Political solution. Absent a political solution, it's very difficult to get someone to admit that there is a problem.

Well, there is a problem, so we're going to create a political problem and also talk about some of the solutions.

The Cypherpunks generally have come up with some of the solutions when we talk about encrypting the entire
intemet. That would end dragnet mass surveillance in a sense, but it will come back in a different sense even
with encryption. We need both a marriage of a technical solution and we need a political solution to go with it,
and if we don't have those two things, we will unfortunately be stuck here.

But at the moment the NSA, basically, | feel, has more power than anyone in the entire word â€” any one agency
or any one person. So Emperor Alexander, the head of the NSA, really has a lot of power. If they want to right

ow, they'll know that the IMEI of this phone is interesting. I's very warm, which is another funny thing, and they
would be able to break into this phone almost certainly and then turn on the microphone, and all without a court.

So that to me is really scary. And | especially dislike the fact that if you were to be building these types of things,
they treat you as an opponent if you wish to be able to fulfil the promises that you make to your customers. And
as someone who writes security software, | think that's bullshit.

So. Here's how they do a bit of it.
