My God!
No, you guys think I’m joking, right? Well, yeah, here it is.

Po
This is a continuous wave generator, a continuous wave radar unit. You can detect its use because its use is
between 1 and 2 GHz and its bandwidth is up to 45 MHz, user adjustible, 2 watts using an internal amplifier,
external amplifier makes it possible to go up to 1 kilowatt.
Just going to let you take that in for a moment. [clears throat] Who's crazy now?
[laughter]
Now, I'm being told | only have one minute, so I'm going to have to go a little bit quicker. I'm sorry.
Here's why they do it. This is an implant called RAGEMASTER.

eS eeldo a ANGRYNEIGHBOR family of tools,
[laughter]
where they have a small device that they put in line with the cable in your monitor and then they use this radar
system to bounce a signal — this is not unlike the Great Seal bug that [Leon] Theremin designed for the KGB. So
it's good to know we've finally caught up with the KGB, but now with computers. They send the microwave
transmission, the continuous wave, it reflects off of this chip and then they use this device to see your monitor.

Yep. So there's the full life cycle. First they radiate you, then you die from cancer, then you... win?

Okay, so, here’s the same thing, but this time for keyboards, USB and PS/2 keyboards.
