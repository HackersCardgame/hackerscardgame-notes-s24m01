Inventor:

Describes the persistence of an effect after the
causing force stopped. For example in
(electro-)magnetism.

Old electron tupe televisions tend to become
magnetized after a while which resulted in a bad
picture, so they have had to be "degaussed".

The same _ principle maybe also works _ for
psychological effects, see m15, t10, m19, col, m9,
t11 or Clark Hull's Formula for Emotions.

Black use Cases

For example to burn al patterns into a
Hacker to sue him and waste his time. Time that he
could better use to defend jounger people from
beeing owned by the CIA
