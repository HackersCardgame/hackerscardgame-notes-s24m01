Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that significantly impairs patients’ ability to intervention on Chinese Toddlers with Autism $ [Autism Res. 2016]
perform normal social interaction and communication. Moreover, the diagnosis procedure of ASD is highly ga. motor delays as dlagnostic clues in autism spectrum

ASD, there is consensus among clinicians regarding the importance of early intervention for the recovery a
of ASD patients. Therefore, to benefit autism patients by enhancing their access to treatments such as early
intervention, we aim to develop a robust machine learning-based system for autism detection by using Seca
