In information extraction, a named entity EWeeiwerekselee, such as persons,
locations, organizations, products, etc., that can be denoted with a proper name. It
can be abstract or have a physical existence. Examples of named entities include
Barack Obama, New York City, Volkswagen Golf, or anything else that can be
named. Named entities can simply be viewed as entity instances (e.g., New York
City is an instance of a city).

From a historical perspective, the term Named Entity was coined during the MUC-6
evaluation campaign!"! and contained ENAMEX (entity name expressions e.g.
persons, locations and organizations) and NUMEX (numerical expression).

A more formal definition can be derived from the rigid designator by Saul Kripke. In
the expression "Named Entity", the word "Named" aims to restrict the possible set
of entities to only those for which one or many rigid designators stands for the
referent.[2] A designator is rigid when it designates the same thing in every possible
world. On the contrary, flaccid designators may designate different things in
different possible worlds.

As an example, consider the sentence, "Trump is the president of the United
States". Both "Trump" and the "United States" are named entities since they refer

to specific objects (Donald Trump and United States). However, "president" is not a named entity since it can be used to refer to many different
objects in different worlds (in different presidential periods referring to different persons, or even in different countries or organizations referring

to different people). Rigid designators usually include proper names as well as certain natural terms like biological species and substances.
