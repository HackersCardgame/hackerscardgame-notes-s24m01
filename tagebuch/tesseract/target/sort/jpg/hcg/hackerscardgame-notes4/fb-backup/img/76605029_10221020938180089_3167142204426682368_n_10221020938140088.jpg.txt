With enough computational Power one could create SELENE

(speech synthesis / deep fakes) that are
co te". = Avatar that can do everything real person
could alse do. Initially they used samples but one would
find out if they use the same sample over and over again.
Sociology design patterns with multiple touring complete
Avatars one even could simulate complete real-live
situations. You can never be sure if person you hear on eg
Stimoceiver/US4877027 is really the person/group you are
talking with. So best thing is to meet face to face (then
they abuse this technology too es if you ano this Pitaon
we you pODLE Possibly find out). | av

Grenowe: If one kaon VS to much about this sort of
technology it would be likely that they create avatars for
the people he knows and trusts, like Family or near friends.
