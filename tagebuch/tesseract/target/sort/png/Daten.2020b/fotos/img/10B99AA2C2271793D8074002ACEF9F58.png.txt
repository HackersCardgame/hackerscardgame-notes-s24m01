Configuring Management Access Rules

You can configure an interface ACL that supports access control for to-the-box management traffic from a specific peer (or set of
peers) to the security appliance. One scenario in which this type of ACL would be useful is when you want to block IKE Denial of
Service attacks.

To configure an extended ACL that permits or denies packets for to-the-box traffic, perform the following steps:

1. Choose Configuration > Device Management > Management Access > Management Access Rules.
2. Click Add, and choose one of the following actions:
‘¢ Add Management Access Rule
‘* Add IPv6 Management Access Rule
‘The appropriate Add Management Access Rule dialog box appears.
3. From the Interface drop-down list, choose an interface on which to apply the rule.
‘The management interface is for management only and cannot be used to configure an access rule.
4, In the Action field, click one of the following radio buttons to choose the action:
‘¢ Permit—Permits access if the conditions are matched.
‘* Deny—Denies access if the conditions are matched.
5. In the Source field, enter an IP address that specifies the network object group, interface IP, or any address from which
traffic is permitted or denied.

Note _IPvé must be enabled on at least one interface before you can configure an extended ACL with an IPv6 address.
For more information about enabling IPv6 on an interface, see the "Configuring IPv6 Addressing" topic

6. In the Service field, add a service name for rule traffic, or click the ellipsis (...) to browse for a service.
7. (Optional) In the Description field, add a description for this management access rule.

‘The description can contain multiple lines; however, each line can be no more than 100 characters in length.

8. (Optional) Logging is enabled by default. You can disable logging by unchecking the check box, or you can change the
Tagging level from the drop-down list. The default logging level is Informational.

9. (Optional) To add a source service (TCP, UDP, and TCP-UDP only) and a time range to your access rule that specifies when
traffic can be allowed or denied, click More Options to expand the list-If you want to turn off this Management Access Rule,
uncheck Enable Rule.

'* Add a source service in the Source Service field, or click the ellipsis (...) to browse for a service.

‘The destination service and source service must be the same. Copy and paste the destination Service field to the
Source Service field.

‘¢ To configure the logging interval (if you enable logging and choose a non-default setting), enter a value in seconds in
the Logging Interval field.

'¢ To select a predefined time range for this rule, from the Time Range drop-down list, choose a time range; or click the
ellipsis (...) to browse for a time range. You can also specify additional time constraints for the time range, such as
specifying the days of the week or the recurring weekly interval in which the time range will be active.

10. Click OK. The dialog box closes, and the Management Access rule is added.
11. Click Apply. The rule is saved in the running configuration.

Note After you create management access rules, you can click the radio buttons at the bottom of the pane to sort the display
and show both IPv4 and IPv6 rules, IPv4 only, or IPv6 only.
