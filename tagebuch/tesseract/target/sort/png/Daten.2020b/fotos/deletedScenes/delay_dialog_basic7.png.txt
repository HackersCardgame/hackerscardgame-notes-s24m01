Delay type: â€˜bouncing bal! makes the echoes occur increasingly dose
together (Faster); reverse bouncing bal! makes them occur increasingly far
apart (slower). In either bouncing bal effect, delay time is not time between
echoes but the * maximum * delay time in bounces.

Applying delay can cause cipping (distortion), especialy when reducing the
decay value and using more echoes. It's normally best to use Effect > Amplify

to set the peak amplitude to -6 dB before using delay.
