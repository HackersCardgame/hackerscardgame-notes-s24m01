DESCRIPTION

Tcpdump prints out a description of the contents of packets on a network >.
that match the boolean expression; the description is preceded by a time stamp,
printed, by default, as hours, minutes, seconds, and fractions of a second since mid-
night. ‘It can also be run with the -w flag, which causes it to save the packet data
to a file for later analysis, and/or with the -r flag, which causes it to read from a
saved packet file rather than to read packets from a network interface (please note
tepdump is protected via an enforcing apparmor(7) profile in Ubuntu which limits the
files tcpdump may access). It can also be run with the -V flag, which causes it to
read a list of saved packet files. In all cases, only packets that match expression
will be processed by tcpdump.
