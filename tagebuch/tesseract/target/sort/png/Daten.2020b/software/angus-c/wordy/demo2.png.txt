SCENE I. London. A street. (1.58%)

GLOUCESTER (Wa)
(1.27%)

Now is the winter of our discontent (1.27%)

‘Made glorious summer by this sun of York; (1.27%)

‘And all the clouds that lour’d upon our housq (1.27%)

In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. (0.9556)

Enter GLOUCESTER, solus

Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;

Our stem alarums changed to merry meetings,

Our dreadful marches to delightful measures
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
