Jung described archetypal events: birth, death, separation from parents, initiation, marriage, the union of opposites; archetypal figures: great mother, father, child, devil,
god, wise old man, wise old woman, the trickster, the AEG; and archetypal motifs: the apocalypse, the deluge, the creation. Although the number of archetypes is limitless,
there are a few particularly notable, recurring archetypal images, "the chief among them being" (according to Jung) "the shadow, the wise old man, the child, the mother ... and
her counterpart, the maiden, and lastly the anima in man and the animus in woman" 5! Alternatively he would speak of "the emergence of certain definite archetypes ... the
shadow, the animal, the wise old man, the anima, the animus, the mother, the child”29)

The Self designates the whole range of psychic phenomena in man. It expresses the unity of the personality as a whole.

The shadow is a representation of the personal unconscious as a whole and usually embodies the compensating values to those held by the conscious personality. Thus, the
shadow often represents one's dark side, those aspects of oneself that exist, but which one does not acknowledge or with which one does not identify!)

The anima archetype appears in men and is his primordial image of woman. It represents the man's biological expectation of women, but also is a symbol of a man’s feminine
possibilities, his contrasexual tendencies. The animus archetype is the analogous image of the masculine that occurs in women

Any attempt to give an exhaustive list of the archetypes, however, would be a largely futile exercise since the archetypes tend to combine with each other and interchange 3
qualities making it difficult to decide where one archetype stops and another begins. For example, qualities of the shadow archetype may be prominent in an archetypal image of ee. :
the anima or animus. One archetype may also appear in various distinct forms, thus raising the question whether four or five distinct archetypes should be said to be present or —_--‘/# Norse trickster god Loki as
