Stanford Welcome to Machine Learning! I'm excited to have you in the class and look forward to helping you become an expert in machine learning.

After you finish watching the Week 1 lectures, there's also a set of Review Questions to help you check your understanding. You should be able to
complete the review questions in a few minutes. You can attempt the review questions as many times as you like, and we will only use your highest

score.

Week 1 how to apply the most advanced machine learning algorithms to such problems as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender

systems, and many other problems. You'll also know how to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as become expert at ‘debugging’ and
Week2 fi figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's performance.
Week 3 hope you'll have a lot of fun learning about machine learning.
