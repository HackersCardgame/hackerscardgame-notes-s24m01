@: Is it just the Catholic church?

A:We have evidence from every major religious group. Where there is power, secrecy and impunity, there is
paedosadism.

@: Arenâ€™t there NGOs fighting this?

A:We have found infilteration of NGOs, HelpLines, police, and every organization set up ostensibly to aid victims. A
high level mafia will always co-opt any organization their victims will run fo.

@: Why don't you leave it fo International organizations like the United Nations and Interpol?

A: There has been high level complicity and cover-ups there too.

@: So is it the Masons? Or the Illuminati?

A:Whatever the origins, this is a problem that not only spans the globe buf also is throughout every layer of society

and can no longer be pinned to one group or reason. It is like metastasized cancer at this point.
