It may be impossible to activate automatically because the server may be down
‘or busy,or security settings may prevent communication with the server. In that
‘case, you can use the manual activation procedure which is made up of four
steps:

1.Click the OK button on this dialog box.

2. This creates a text file containing your code, a unique identifier for your
machine, and a product code. If you create this on a machine with no Internet
‘connection, copy this tex to another machine and send it from there.

3. Copy this information into an email message and send it to our activation
service at VO support <Ims.support@visionobjects.com>. We will make an
activation file and send it back to you by mail. This file can only be used on one
machine - the machine where the original request was created.

4, Double-click the licence.lic file attached to the mail. This opens a small
application that activates the handwriting recognition software.
