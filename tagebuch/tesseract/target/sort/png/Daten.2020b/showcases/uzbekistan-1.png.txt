PHP session_start()

What is this really?

1g Does it start a current session based on cookies? Got that from the PHP website. How does
PHP control the session? If | start a session when a user opens up my login page, what do |
even use that session for? Can | use the current session to get info about the logged in user?

The PHP session system lets you store securely data in the $_SESsToN global array. A typical
example is to store the user's identifier in the session when they type in their password:
22

if (Suser = try_login($login, $password))
$_SESSION['user'] = $user;

YM _ Then, you can access that information on all other pages
if (isset($_sesston['user']))

logged in |
echo user_nane($_SESSION['user']);

The data is stored on the server, so there is no risk of tampering (on the other hand, mind your
disk usage)

Starting the session lets the current request use $_SESSION . If this is the user's first visit, the
array will be empty and a new session cookie will be sent for you

Closing the session merely prevents the current request from using $_SESSTON , but the data
stays around for the next requests.

Destroying the session throws away all the data, forever. The sessions are destroyed a certain
duration after the last visit (usually around 30 minutes).

Oooh okay. So it's an empty global array that you can use to store user values (or other values), to
maintain their unique experience within the website. — Scott Oct 25 10 at 14.56
