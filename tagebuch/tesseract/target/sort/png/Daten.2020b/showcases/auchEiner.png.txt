That difference was Ebba Akerlund.

Young, innocent and dead Ebba.

Ebba was walking to meet her mother after school, when she was
murdered by an Islamic attacker, driving a stolen vehicle through the
shopping promenade on which she was walking. Ebba was partially deaf,
unable to hear the attacker coming.

Ebba death at the hands of the invaders, the indignity of her violent
demise and my inability to stop it broke through my own jaded cynicism
like a sledgehammer.
