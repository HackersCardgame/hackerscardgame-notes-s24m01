Mare Jr Landolt in my case it was just my own brain. There is
something that is called intimate zone. If someone was rude to me,
my intimate zone was disrespected. In Science the intimate zone is
the distance where you respect friends or foreigners. but in case of
Schizophrenic people, offending you with a simple word can
disrespect your intimate zone in a metaphorical sense. When,
someone important was rude to me, i heard his voice like an echo,
over and over again. and this made me feel bad

offended with words?

@ Mare Jr Landolt well i guess the problem is that the
schizophrenic mind is more sensible to words. i realized that
some things eg. my chief said were just stupid but not mean.
but my schizophrenic mind could not differentiate those two
things. maybe if i would have told him he would have been
more careful what words he used
