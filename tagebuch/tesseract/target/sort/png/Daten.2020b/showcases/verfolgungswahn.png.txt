Why did you carry out the attack?
To most of all show the invaders that our lands will never be their lands,

our homelands are our own and that, as long as a white man still lives,
they will NEVER conquer our lands and they will never replace our
people.

To take revenge on the invaders for the hundreds of thousands of deaths
caused by foreign invaders in European lands throughout history.

To take revenge for the enslavement of millions of Europeans taken from
their lands by the Islamic slavers.

To take revenge for the thousands of European lives lost to terror attacks
throughout European lands.
