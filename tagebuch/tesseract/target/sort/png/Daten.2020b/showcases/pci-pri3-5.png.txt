uups

have you run ./dbconfigfiles.sh and imported the watchdog user?

yes

its working for some time but then it crashes

for how long?

one time for 30mins

other time for 10

other time for thr

but at least it restars

no

here it does not do that,

because it cant bind

the watchdog tries to kill and restart it

but somehow the process is still open and therefor it cant bind

are you on head of master?

yes

here i have no problem, it works since hours

could it be, that you still have anoter udpserver open?

end the server

then type fg

and when then the server pops up again, then there is still a instance running

fg = ForderGround

iwill be away now

ok

Iwill let it run

and see if it crashes again

and if it crashes make a ps -x without killing it, and copy the content or screenshot of ps -x to issues

maybe later we can do a teamviewer session so that i can debug on the system, if we go over your computer and you enter the password then you can unplug the net if you fear that i do

something bad

another thing you can try is to completely delete the pci35 dir and clone everything new from the git, maybe there is a bug in your repo

and maybe you need to rebuild your database completely with the script, maybe you have a bug there
i did again some tests here, i can not brick it here.

and have you started it with /startServer.sh?

boris?

ok i ready must go now

boris im back
