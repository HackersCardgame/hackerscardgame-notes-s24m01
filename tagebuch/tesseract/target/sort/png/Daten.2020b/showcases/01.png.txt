People normally dont admit that they are Schizophrenic ‘cause in many
Movies/Series the Schizophrenic is the evil guy so they deny (homeostasis of
the self) ask yourself, why should you be a target and compare this to the
probability having the bad luck of having Schizophrenia 1%

maybe it's though a virus, called Toxoplasma gondii [1] that causes
Schizophrenia and not some magical CyberWeapon DEW with hightech speech
emulation, but people often are not able to admit that they are Schizophrenic...

You sound like your brain is producing a lot of dopamine (to much self-
assurance) in my opinion it is more likely that you suffer from Schizophrenia. At
least in my case, since i take *Xeplion im not a “*Targetedindividual" anymore.
