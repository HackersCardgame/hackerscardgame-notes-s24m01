Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~??2?
Electronics Book for Kids, Verlag: Stuttgart Frech,
1977. Warning, if the kid bought or recievied this
book in the age of 10 it would be very likely that
someone else wants to use him as scapegoat, and
maybe the father of this kid is just the second
scapegoat.

But it is my bad, that i spied on equal aged girls in
scout camp, it worked but poorly
