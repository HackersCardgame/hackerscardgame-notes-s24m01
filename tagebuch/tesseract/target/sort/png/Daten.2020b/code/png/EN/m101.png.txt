Rational Unified Process means _ iterative software
development process framework. People seem to use this
Grapics (where there is an initial process that then triggers
another processes) as a way for hiding their crimes. For
example if you call a 20 years old guy (dark yellow) a
criminal the would maybe get a permit for survaillance of
this 20 years old "man", from the stalking jury it would look
the 20 years old "man" triggered all the problems (yellow,
green, turquoise) the joury would maybe not notice the initial
event that caused these events because thy dont stalk the
real criminal (red) so they maybe even decide to kill the boy
(dark yellow) See the m37 Card. Maybe Red uses this
concept even to hid crimes like murderer that he commited
and then would use the jury to kill the scapegoat (m46->dt1)
the problem would be that if dark yellow is dead red would
just take the next scapegoat and kill again. it is likely that
red uses strong crypto and things like t1, t12... cards.
