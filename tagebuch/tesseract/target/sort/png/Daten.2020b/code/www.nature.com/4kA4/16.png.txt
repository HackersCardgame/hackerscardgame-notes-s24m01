Percentage accuracies of move prediction for neural networks trained by reinforcement learning (that is, AlphaGo Zero) or supervised learning. For supervised learning, the network was trained for 3
days on KGS data (amateur games); comparative results are also shown from ref. 12. For reinforcement learning, the 20-block network was trained for 3 days and the 40-block network was trained for
40 days. Networks were also evaluated ona validation set based on professional games from the GoKifu dataset.
