Extended Data Figure 5

AlphaGo Zero (40 blocks) self-play games. The 40-day training run was subdivided into 20 periods. The best player from
each period (as selected by the evaluator) played a single game against itself, with 2 h time controls. One hundred moves are shown for each game; full
games are provided in the Supplementary Information.
