Hey, I just proved that the earth
revolves around the sun!
Not the other way around!

HERESY! ~

Recant your findings or
spend the rest of your

can be used to treat leukemia!

HERESY!

DEVILS harvest stem cells
from the SOULS of

from the Catholic church!

Do it for the babies, you infant-eating devibeast
