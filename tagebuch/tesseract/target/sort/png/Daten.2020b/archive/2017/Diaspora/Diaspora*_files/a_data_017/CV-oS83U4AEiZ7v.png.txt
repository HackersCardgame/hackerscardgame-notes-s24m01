Dear @coldhakca,

As a precaution, we are alerting you that your Twitter account is one
of a small group of accounts that may have been targeted by state-
sponsored actors. We believe that these actors (possibly associated
with a government) may have been trying to obtain information such as
email addresses, IP addresses, and/or phone numbers.

At this time, we have no evidence they obtained your account
information, but we're actively investigating this matter. We wish we
had more we could share, but we don’t have any additional information
we can provide at this time.

It’s possible your account may not have been an intended target of the
suspected activity, but we wanted to alert you as soon as possible. We
recognize that this may be of particular concern if you choose to Tweet
using a pseudonym. For tips on protecting your identity online, you may
want to visit the "Tor Project (https://www.torproject.org/)" or EFF’s

“Protecting Yourself on Social Networks" (https: //ssd.eff.org/en/module
/protecting-yourself-social -networks) .
