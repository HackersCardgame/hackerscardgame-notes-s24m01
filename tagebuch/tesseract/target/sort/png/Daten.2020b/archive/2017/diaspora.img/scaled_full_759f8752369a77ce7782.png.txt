FREE SOFTWARE

FOUNDATION

“| want this piece of software,
even though | know it's wrong
to download it. But if | like it, |
might actually pay for it to
support the author.”

“Software isn't property. The
data is on my computer now, it
belongs to me. The author
should get a real job instead of
taking my freedom."
