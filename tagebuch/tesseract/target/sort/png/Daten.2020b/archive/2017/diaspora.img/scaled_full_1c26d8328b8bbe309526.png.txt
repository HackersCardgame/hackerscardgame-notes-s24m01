never poem’ cat capitalism.txt

You know what it means
when the alarm ring is active
Jump into your jeans,

smile and get productive

Like a bee producing honey
the day is bright and sunny,
but your work is not funny,
and you could use more money?

Well, first you must learn:
The more you work, the less you earn,

the more power you

burn,

and now it's your turn.

We offer great service,
much more than sufficient,

to clients and employees,

as long as you're efficient.

Don't worry ‘bout our debt,
"cause we're not gonna pay.

ALL you need is to accept
that money's got all say.

So come on and join!
Yes, we are employin',
enjoy your tenderloin

Oh, another verse?
