That’s okay, I suppose.

But

would you kill for your religion?

Would you hurt, hinder, or condemn
in the name of your God?

C, Yes? y

Then you probably

suck at your religion.
You should give it up.

Maybe take Up windsurfing
or ping pong instead.

However,
Does your religion inspire you to

help peor)
Does it make you
(—_ happier?
Does it help you cope with

the fact that you are a

bag of meat

sitting on a rock

in outer space

and that someday you will

DIt

and you are completely

powerless, helpless, and

insignificant

in the wake of this
beautiful cosmic shitstorm

we call

existence?

Does it help with that? Yes?

EXCELLENT!

CARRY ON WITH
YOUR RELIGION
