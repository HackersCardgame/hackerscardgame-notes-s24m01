Protect your communications.

The first step, Snowden says, is to encrypt your phone calls and texts.
The easiest way to do that is with an app, Signal, that’s free and approved
by computer security experts.

Lock down your hard drive.

If you don't encrypt your data, someone with your computer and basic
skills could read all your files. Snowden’s fix? Turn on encryption on all
your computing devices. It's pretty easy, and tools are built into Windows,
Mac OS X, iOS, and Android.

Keep your passwords straight.

One of the riskiest online behaviors is reusing the same password for multiple
sites. So if someone gets your password by hacking, say, an online store, and
it's the same password as your email, you could be in a lot of trouble. Snowden
recommends using a password manager to make unique, secure passwords for
every site, and it will help you remember them as well.

Turn on two-factor.

Two-factor simply means that if you’re logging into a website, your password
won't be enough — you'll need to certify it’s you by receiving a text message
or emall. Snowden recommends turning two-factor on for everything that
supports it, including Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox, and your Apple ID.
