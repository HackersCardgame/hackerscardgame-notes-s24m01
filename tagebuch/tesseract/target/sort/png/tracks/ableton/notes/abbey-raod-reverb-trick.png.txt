ABBEY ROAD REVERB TRICK

The Abbey Road Reverb trick is essentially an EQ before the reverb
ona send channel with a 600Hz hi-pass and a 10kHz low-pass.

This technique eliminates annoying high-end frequency content
and cuts out the low-end mud from the reverb which
increases the clarity.

Itâ€™s important to mention that the two frequency points are merely
guidelines. Never be afraid to experiment with the range.
