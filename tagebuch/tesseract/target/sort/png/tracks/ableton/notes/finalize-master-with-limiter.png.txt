Finalize Your Master with
a Limiter

When mastering, always start with limiting! Put your
limiter on first (even though itâ€™s the last in the mastering
processing chain) and then adjust the levels in your mix.

Getting your mix to sound as balanced as possible without
grabbing an EQ will always sound more transparent and
clean.
