Transient Shaping with
Beats Mode

When playing with loops inside Ableton Live, try playing with Beats
mode. When Beats mode is selected, change the Transient Looping mode to
Off (->|), and adjust the amount to taste. Lowering the amount will give you

more of the initial transient, giving you a tighter feel.
