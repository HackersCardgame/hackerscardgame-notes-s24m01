Try Auto Panning Your Hats

Try using an auto pan on your hats. Even a simple high-hat
pattern can feel much more human and detailed with simple
back and forth movement. Bonus perspective: making music

on a computer is one big massive attempt at sounding
more human. Make things sound less digital with movement
tricks, humanization, randomness, added dynamics, etc.
