Architecture and operating systems («xt
{As of November 2018, all supercomputers on TOPS00 are 63-bit, mostly based on CPUS Using the x86-64 instruction set architecture (of which 474
are Intel EMT64-based and 6 are AMD AMD-based). The few exceptions are al based on RISC architectures). Thirteen supercomputers, including
the top two, are based on the Power ISA used by IBM POWER microprocessors, three on Fujsu-designed SPARC64 chips, two on ARM architecture,
‘and one on the Chinese Sunway SW/26010 design, One computer uses another non-US design the Japanese PEZY'SC (based on the British ARM!) as
an accelerator paired with intel's xeon.

In recent years heterogeneous computing, mostly using Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPU) or Intel's x86-based Xeon Phi as coprocessors, has
dominated the TOPS00 because of better performance per watratios and higher absolute performance; tis almost requited to make the top 10 of
the top spat; the only major recent exception being the aforementioned K computer an Sunway TaihuLigh. Tianhe:2 is alzo an interesting
exception, as while itd use accelerators Gust not GPUS), ie. Xeon Phi, US sanctions blocked the upgrade, but stil the upgraded Tianhe-2A is faster
with non-US-based Matrix-2000,91 accelerators which where exploited ahead of schedule, Frontera supercomputer, ranked Sth, based on 28-core
(S6:thread) Intl Xeon Platinum is alzo an exception, as i was measured without help of GPUs which were later added) butit has two subsystems,
both with nvidia GPUS, and one of them additionally with POWERS CPUs, and the other lquld immersion cooing 2122)

“wo computers which fst appeared onthe list in 2018 are based on architectures never before seen on the TopS00, One was a new x86-64
mmicroarchitecture from Chinese vendor Sugon, using Hygon Ohyana CPUs (these result from a collaboration with AMD, and are a minor variant of
Zenvbased AMD EPYC) andi ranked 3ath,"9) and the other was the first ever ARM¢-based computer an the list then upgraded fr june 2029) —using

‘made up most TOP500 supercomputers, including RISC architectures such as SPARC, MIPS, PA-RISC and Alpha

high for ether.

Iehas been well over a decade since MIPS systems dropped entirely ofthe list!) but the Gyoukow supercomputer that jumped to 4th place in November 2017 (after a huge upgrade) has MIPS as a small partof the coprocessor. Use of
2,088-core coprocessor (plus 8x 6-core MIPS, foreach, that “no longer require to rely on an external ntl Xeon E5 host processor“) make the supercomputer much more energy efficient than the other top 10 (ie. tis Sth on Green500

and Sequoia became the last Blue Gene/O models to drop out ofthe top10; they had been ranked Sth and 10th inthe S2nd list (and 2st and 2nd inthe November 2012, 40th lit) and are now 12th and 13th

For the first time, all 500 systems deliver a petaflop or more on the High Performance Linpack (HPL) benchmark, with the entry level tothe list now at 1.022 petaflops” However, fora different benchmark “Summit and Sierra remain the
only two systems to exceed a petalop on the HPCG benchmark, delivering 2.9 petaflops and 1.8 ptaflops, respectively. The average HPCG result onthe current lists 213.3 teraflps, a marginal increase from 221.2 six menths ago.)
