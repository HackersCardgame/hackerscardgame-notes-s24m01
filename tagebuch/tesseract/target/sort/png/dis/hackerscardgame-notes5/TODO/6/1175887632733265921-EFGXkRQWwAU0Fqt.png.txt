In his book, Principles of Behavior*)he developed the following formula:
SERe SH OVER
where:
Ex is excitatory potential ikelnood that the organism would produce response rto stimulus),
sas the habit strength (derived from previous conditioning ta),
Dis rive strength (determined by, e.. the hours of deprivation of food, water, et.)

Vis stimulus intensity dynamism (some stimuli will have greater influences than others, such asthe lighting of situation),
and Kisincentve how appealing the result of the action is!)

A variety of other factors were gradually added to the formula to account for results no included by this simple function, Eventually the formula became:

SEq = VXDXK IX SH

‘such tha ps reactive inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that disipates over time),

‘nis conditioned inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance ofa behavior that does not dissipate over time).

Ln is Reaction threshold the smallest amount of reinforcement that wil produce learning,

Hull orginally intended to make a trilogy of books on behavior, explaining socal and cognitive behavior! instead, he focused on continuously revising his orginal formula as exceptions showed up.)
Mulls emphasis was on experimentation, an organized theory of learning, andthe nature of habits, which he argued were associations between a stimulus anda response'] Behaviors were influenced by goals that sought to satisfy
primary rives~such as hunger, thts, ex, and the avoidance of pain. Hi systematic behavior theory, also known as drive theory, i thatof a reinforcement system, which means that in learning, habit are initally formed by reinforcing
certain behaviors. Reinforcement of a response to a behavior supplies an effet that satisfies @ need. In other words, this satisfaction of needs helps create habits out of behaviors, Specifically, Hull's theory posts that behaviors that satisfy
reeds, ater described by Hull as cravings rather than needs, reduce these cravings. He called this concept drive-reducton, or drive-stimulus reduction.)

‘ther behavioriss found Hull's theories tobe too cumbersome for practical use, leading to his work to be eclipsed by Skinner!)

1 1936 Hull worked with students and associates and together they started a series of evening seminars that became known as "Monday Night Meetings”. They would discus topics such as conditioned reflexes, behavior laws, and Freud's
psychoanalysis. These meetings became popular with many kinds of people, uch as psychologists, aciologiss, and anthropologists and sometimes as many as seventy people would attend) National Academy of Sciences Later in fe
wen Hull was in poor healt, he had the help of his research assistants and volunteers to conduct his experiments. He aso relied on people to keep him upto date on current discussions on current psychological experiments and theories
that he was unable to attend and participate in

Hull was one ofthe most frequently cited psychologists during the 1940s and 195051”) Apttude Testing (1928) was a widely quoted textbook and his work Hypnosis and Suggestibilt: An Experimental Approach (1933) was widely studied,
ull’ Principles of Behavior (1943) was one ofthe most widely cited books in psychology”? In an old Handbook of Experimental Psychology. his work was mentioned on over eighty pages, which was more than al ther scientists atthe
‘ime. in previous issues ofthe Journal of Experimental Psychology and the Psychological Review over forty percent ofthe bibliographies included one or more of his writings.)

Hull advised and inspired a number of graduate students and psychologists that went onto revise his theories and make contributions t the field of psychology. Some ofthese important people influenced by Mull were Albert Bandura,
"Neal miler, John Dollard, Kenneth Spence, and janet Taylor Spence)

John Dollard taught anthropology, psychology and sociology a Yale and was interested in studying social class and specif learning experiences. Neal Mller studled under Hull at Yale, which is where he earned his Ph.D. Miller also founded
the Laboratory of Physiological Psychology at Rockefeller University in New York, which fs where he conducted research on animal taining and this work helped to develop biofeedback. Miler and Dollard collaborated and developed a
social learning theory that was successfully applied to psychotherapy and understanding. Their book, Socal Learning and imitation, sted the four fundamentals necessary for instrumental learning. These were dive, cue, response and
reward and were based on Hull's drive reduction theory of learning 7) They used a similar construct to Hull's theory, however, they proposed that any strong stimulus could have motivating or drive properties without essentially being
tied tothe need ofthat particular organism.8! Their book, Personality and Psychotherapy (1950) is considered tobe a very important book fr it combined Mulan learning theory with psychoanalysis and helped to lay the foundation of
copalive behavieral therapy.
