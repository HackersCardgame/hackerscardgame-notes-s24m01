Version 1.x. [edit]

* SVG 1.0 became a W3C Recommendation on 4 September 2001.[17]
* SVG 1.1 became a W3C Recommendation on 14 January 2003.!"8] The SVG 1.1 specification is modularized in order to allow subsets to be defined as profiles.
Apart from this, there is very little difference between SVG 1.1 and SVG 1.0.
‘* SVG Tiny and SVG Basic (the Mobile SVG Profiles) became W3C Recommendations on 14 January 2003. These are described as profiles of SVG 1.1.19]
* SVG Tiny 1.2 became a W3C Recommendation on 22 December 2008.9 It was initially drafted as a profile of the planned SVG Full 1.2 (which has since been
dropped in favor of SVG 2),!2"] but was later refactored as a standalone specification.
* SVG 1.1 Second Edition, which includes all the errata and clarifications, but no new features to the original SVG 1.1 was released on 16 August 2011.{4]

Version 2.x [edit]

removes or deprecates some features of SVG 1.1 and incorporates new features from HTML5 and Web Open Font Format:

+ For example, SVG 2.0 removes several font elements such as glyph and altGlyph (replaced by the WOFF font format).
* The xml: space attribute is deprecated in favor of CSS.
+ HTMLS features such as translate and data-* attributes have been added.

It reached Candidate Recommendation stage on 15 September 2016. The latest draft was released on 26 May 2020.!22)

Profiles {edit}

Because of industry demand, two mobile profiles were introduced with SVG 1.

VG Tiny (SVGT) and SVG Basic (SVGB).

These are subsets of the full SVG standard, mainly intended for user agents with limited capabilities. In particular, SVG Tiny was defined for highly restricted mobile
devices such as cellphones; it does not support styling or scripting.(?9] SVG Basic was defined for higher-level mobile devices, such as smartphones.

In 2003, the 3GPP, an international telecommunications standards group, adopted SVG Tiny as the mandatory vector graphics media format for next-generation phones.

‘SVGT is the required vector graphics fo format and support of SVGB is optional for Multimedia Messaging S Service (MMS) and Packet-switched Streaming Service.
