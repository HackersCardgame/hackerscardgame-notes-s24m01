So there is a planetary strategic surveillance system, and there - well, there are many of them
actually. Everything from | think off-planetary surveillance gear, which is probably the National

Reconnaissance Office and their satellite systems for surveillance like the Keyhole satellites - these

are all things most, for the most part we actually know about these things. They're on Wikipedia. |
But | want to talk a little bit more about the internet side of things because | think that’s really

fascinating.

So part of what we are releasing today with Der Spiegel or what has actually been released - just to
be clear on the timeline, I'm not disclosing it first, I'm working as an independent journalist

you don’t have standing to prove that you've been surveilled unless we release that kind of
information, but we don’t want to release that kind of information in case it could be a legitimate
target, and we - I'm really uncomfortable with that term, but let's say that there is a legitimate
target, the most legitimate target, and we didn’t want to make that decision. But we did also want
to make sure that we didn’t harm someone, but we also wanted to show concrete examples. So if
you look at the Spiegel stuff on line, we redacted the names even of those who were victimized by
the NSA’s oppressive tactics, which | think actually goes further than is necessary, but | believe that
