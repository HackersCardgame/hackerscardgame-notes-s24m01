The things Hackaday readers come up with and post over on Hackaday.o never cease to amaze us. If

you've never checked it out, be careful — you can easily spend hours (or weeks) of your life just skimming
through the projects that have been logged there. Many of the builds use modem development tools like | searct |

Arduino and Raspberry Pi, but every so often we come across a project that takes a more difficult road.

That's the case with {Keplermatik’s] Cold War-era satelite-tracking project, also aptly named Keplermatk. NEWER MISS A HACK

This a build that’s stil in progress, which just means you've got the privilege of following along as it
progresses! What makes this project so special? Aside from the fact that it's purpose is to track satellites,
we think the sole use of vintage tech is a very cool and very ambitious goal

;Keplermatik] plans to spit the satelitetracking
console into two sides: an American-tech side for
‘racking the satellite's position, and a Soviettech
side for tuning the radio and positioning the
antenna. The idea is that hell get to use vintage
technology from both sides of the Iron Curtain
That should lead to some very interesting lessons
about how these kinds of systems were designed
by each side during the Cold War.

UP-CLOSE LOOK AT

The build is stil in ts adolescence, but is defintely
worth following along with. But, if you're craving
more Soviet tech and need it right now, be sure to
