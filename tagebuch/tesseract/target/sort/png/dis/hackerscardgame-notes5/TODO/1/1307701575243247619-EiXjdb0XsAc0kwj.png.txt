ferent options for spying on you
‘So that's a pretty scary thing, and
basically their goa! is to have total survetlance of everything that they are interested in. So there really is no
boundary to what they want to do. There is only sometimes a boundary of what they are funded to be able to do
‘and the amount of things they're able to do at scale. They seem to just do those things without thinking too much
about it, and there are specific tactical things where they have to target a group or an individual, and those
‘things seem limited ether by budgets or simply by their time. And as we have released today on Der Spiegers
‘website, which it should be live - I ust checked, it should be live for everyone here — we actually show a whole
bunch of details about their budgets as well as the individuals involved with the NSA and the Tailored Access
‘Operations group in terms of numbers.

So t should ge you a rough idea showing that there was a smal period of time in which the internet was realy
free and we did not have people from he U.S. mitary that were watching overt and expoting everyone on t.
and now we see every year that the number of people who are hired to break into people's computers as part of
‘grand operations, those people are groning day by day, actualy, and every year tere are more and more
people that are allocated, and we see this growth,

So that's the goal Nonattrbution, and total surveilance, and they want to do it completely in the dark.

‘The good news is that they can't. $o, now Im going to show you a bit about i. But first, before | show you any
pictures, | want to sort of give you the big picture from the top down
