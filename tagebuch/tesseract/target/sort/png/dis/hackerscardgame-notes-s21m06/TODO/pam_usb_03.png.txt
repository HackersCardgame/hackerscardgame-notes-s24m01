pamusb is on NSAICIA Huntdown list #44
braindet his is Jan 13, 2020 4 ¢

hello @STAR-Sec

i always end up in mental institutions when i try to revive pam-usb. Alluzardis version does not work on stretch, buster and bullseye.
all the people that forked it and also tried to fix it seem to never finish thier work. it looks like some sort of cyber-mass-grave if you
look at the forks

so my hypothesis:

premise 1:
pam-usb would prevent that people get access to your linux box with i2c, hardware keylogger, maybe intelME and other low-tech
methods that focus on getting your password (if you properly unplug the key and lock when you walk away)

so if you would have some important data about local powerful people they maybe would want to delete this data. such things
happen, see the case Gust! Mollath in Germany.

in this case the attacker would need some more powerful hacking tolls (exploits) ke kernel exploits, exploits of firmware blobs in
eg. Networking cards

premise 2:
as far as i heard the secret services are internationally share such exploits among the agencies (source: To Protect and Infect Part
2 from Jacob Applebaum). So just in case in case i really have some relevant information about my local city (only 16k People) then
they maybe would make use of such a bigger attack.

even if im completely wrong, pam-usb lets you sleep better, because you maybe feel bad if you have been owned, but you feel less
bad if you see that the other older people use really big tools, but they just use them, they did not develop them. So even when you
don't win the game not to be owned, you though will win the psychological warfare "game" since the other party uses products they
bought for lots of money.

My opinion: the NSA (technology) is just the support guy of CIA (that spin-doctos news, does mindcontrol or even overthrow
governments that is proven in many cases)

Ifyou can falsify my hypothesis and premises i would be happy, but as long you can not better think of mental institutions as some
instrument of mindcontrol, not for all patients but for some, CCC even has a notice on their congress page for getthing help with
mental institutions. And just btw Jacob Applebaum's Mother ended up in a mental institution too, that does not mean that she is a
great hacker like jake, but they go against your whole family, so therefor i question mental institutions.

in the end pam-usb is working on buster and bulleseye: https:l/github. com/braindefipam_usb/ but onetime pad not yet done, and
also not audited. | can write large C/C++ projects, but when it comes to such things i tend to get in serios trouble, and end up in
mental institutions, even when i was still using windows and the proprietary product Proteg (thats some sort of windows-pam-usb) i
had the same problem.
