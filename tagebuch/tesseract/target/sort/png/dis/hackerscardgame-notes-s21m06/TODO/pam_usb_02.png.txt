pamusb is on NSAICIA Huntdown list
braindet his is Jan 13

keystrokes they could not login to my linux.

in 2015 i had still problems so was reading && twittering about EquationGroup things.
https:iigithub. com/braindefiHackersCardgame6iblob/master/jpg/EN/e6 jpg

so i ended up in a mental institution again
https:iigithub. com/braindef/HackersCardgame6iblob/master/jpg/ENIm138 jpg

(in german mental institution means "Psychiatrie" and if you ask Jaro-Winkler-Algorithm, Psychiatrie and Psychologische
Kriegsfahrung (PsychologicalWarfare) does not match, but im not quite sure about that)

in the famous talk "To protect and infect, Part 2" from @ioerror Jake talks about that they use all 13 attack vectors you know only
10. but i think they also need to unlock them somehow().

pam_usb is really great to make you live worse, but in fact it makes it better since it helps people to reduce the equation.

further it seems that everything that is pam-related has some Layer 8 (|SO-OS!) malware, some sort of psychological warfare
socio-psychology design patterns, that you can enumerate and identify as false, some i can not, so the only way to prevent me from
doing things like HackersCardgame::m44 would be to disable or jam sigint / comit

(this thing was 70 years ago)

but i got it running somehow for debian bulllseye
https:ligithub. com/braindefipam_usbitree/debian-bullseye2
(one-time pad not yet done)

after that they possibly overwritten my bootsector maybe with Equation Group Malware, that would have some remote interface
like the eyefi wireless SD Card, or tempest.
(s0 if you see a electron microscope laying around please tell me)

Not sure what you mean by using "Psychological Warfare against those who would like to continue pamusb development’. Or why
anyone would want to target those working on it. You said this software was related to OSI malware but its still present here so do
you mind providing more details as to what the f*ck your talking about. Seems to be my inability to understand what your referring to
however not meant to carry a aggressive tone.
