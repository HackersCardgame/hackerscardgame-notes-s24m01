Inventor:
We guess the NSA/CIA works with the principle of
seduction. He gives the people the opportunity to get
money if they sell their soul, or if they sell their soul
just a little bit. With and 100 Years of
DataRetention
. Thy used m66 Card as Scapegoat.
One working hack to work around this principle is to
confess what you have done. Me for example | drove
drunken car and did other things, so i tried to turn
myself in, but they said that this sins were expired.
From that point in time the NSA/CIA System couldn't
blackmail me with this sins anymore, unfortunately
they then begun to shoot against my sexual integrity.
Nun not included in all use
cases.
