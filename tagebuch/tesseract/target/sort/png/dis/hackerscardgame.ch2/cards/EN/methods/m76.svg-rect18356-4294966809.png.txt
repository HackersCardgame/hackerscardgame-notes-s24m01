Think about it, you don't hold the mouse you ARE the mouse, inverse psychology

Based on this stimulus you can populate more stimuli

if you use Linux, maybe you try an eg. Apple Theme on your

Inventor: XXXXX

Formula from Clark Hull describing how programm Stimulus-
Response-Habits. Today it is "possibly" implemented in
software. The sort of Deprivation or the Stimulus would
maybe change randomly. The "PsychologyKeys" would be the
same. The communication channel (t1, t... cards) are maybe
randomized too and worst case they would do things like
frequency hopping. Psychological dimension: things like

, for example 17 years torture or "white"
torture after an initial great user experience (m38 card)
would be important too. (to my equal aged mistress: "user
experience" just fun). They also generalize things, first i
feared gun-shot noises, then firework, today i fear every
single noise. This seems to be one of the main weapons to
prevent innocent victims from leaking the truth or if people
like me try to warn other people from this sort of attacks and
that they could protect themselves eg. with earplugs or
Noise-cancelling headphones
