One-way mirrors are normally used against acused people.
And the same principle is being applied to computers too.
In some cases it is maybe legitimate to use such
technology to prevent bigger disasters. But it is also some
sort of Instrument of Power and Instruments of Power
tends to be abused, sepecially when the agent that uses
this sort of technology has it's own records that would
bring some years in jail. Especially those agents would
abuse it. Since

this sort of software is owned by
bigger parties such as NSA / CIA (single spanning tree /
kerberos) and would even force the agent to abuse this
technology to protect himself from being sentenced, so
people would need more and more of such software and
would try to get more access on this system (forced
neurosis), worst case people abuse this already here: '%ยง.
