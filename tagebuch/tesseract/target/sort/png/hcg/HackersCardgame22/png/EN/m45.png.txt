Inventor: xxxxx Year! ~????

Lot of people live normal lives, living not as a saint but
also not a live as satan. They have their routine, their
places where they do things like hobbies and where they
look TV. But if one finds out, that his company sold a
software to a children hospital that would risk lifes of kids
and then tries to force the chief to fix that chiefs tend to
become angry about such an employee. When you are
young you are maybe not aware of such problems. A
normal reaction of the chief would be to intimidate the
employee to stay silent, if you are one of this sort of
people that can't silent, it is very likely to end up as a
homeless, but maybe you saved many lives of innocent
kids. In my case they used it about 6 Months to blackmail
me, they said when i would not be silent in my
appartment they would have a reason to kick me out, i
was silent, noted things in my diary, though my flat
