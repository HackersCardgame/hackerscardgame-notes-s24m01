If one would evaluate the mouse-gestures
one could control the same system like
described in t46. As far as | know, windos
does not record mouse gestures. SO one
could control many things without having a
logfile, theoretically.

Technically

[ dx/dt | dy/dt | => [f,'(t) | fy'"'(t)

into a Matrix and compare this Matrix with
codes / cammands that are available. one
could do it more complex but that would be
sufficient i guess.
