The observer pattern (also called listener pattern) is
a design pattern in software development. It belongs
to the category of behavior patterns.
Non techology enthusiasts think maybe that
"observer pattern" means that all the IT and
Computer Science People are doing _ illegal
Surveillance and even work for the NSA / CIA (Bad
generalization). But in fact the term

has nothing to do with surveillance. But of
course this could also be abused in
illegal surveillance.

To learn this implement an Observer Pattern eg. in
Java or Python
