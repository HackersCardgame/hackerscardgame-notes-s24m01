With stimulus-response habits,

(m8, see also card bl, b2, b3, tl...) and
after 1000 repetitions you would get punishment instead
of a reward (m7) they can induce rage. Or if a person
invests a lot of time in a game and then would be banned
forever from the Game (more worse if was an unfair
decision) this can induce rage. If one has something like a
working that protects him/her then
such psychological attacks could not kill, but if the spinal
cord is hacked people can be killed without Psychological
Warfare / Cognitive Dissonances. Such Software can
produce people that run amok or suicide. You can not
only blame the remote Controlled Person. Try to find both,
the remote controlled BOT and the person developed that
interface or Server or abuses it. https://marclandolt.ch/
