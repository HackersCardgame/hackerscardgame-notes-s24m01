Each (sub-)culture has its, heroes, enemies, rites,
symbols and “secrets”

Trevor Paglen “collected* such symbols and wrote a
book: "| Could Tell You But Then You Would
Have to Be Destroyed By Me: Emblems from the
Pentagon's Black World" Find those symbols of
common sense and you will find maybe hints to the
truth and the whole picture. I'm not sure if such
symbols are “The Mark of Cain" or symbolize just a
group membership in the real word or in
computergames, But beeing member of a bigger
system maybe compensates also low self-esteern,
question would be, who caused the low selfesteem
initially
