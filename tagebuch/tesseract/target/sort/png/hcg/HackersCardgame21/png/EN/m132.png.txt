In there is a scene where the lost pirates

play for fewer years of service. This parable is promoted also in the
real world. To quote Jack: "

"| For example a criminal or a pedophile father that
eg. rapes his daughter and uses eg. his son as a scapegoat. (German:
"Fremdspurlegung"). This way the criminal father would win time to do
more crimes while the scapegoat would be naked to the justice
system, would face prison, mental institution and wastes a lot of his
time. . We guess
the CIA suggested the combination of m72 && m132 to all the older
people and just a few could resist. The CIA owned people would get
support by other sinners and the CIA. With NSA BigData and 100 Years
Dataretention it's esay to blackmail and abuse them (m74). System is
autopoietic, except the younger people can prove it, then the real
criminal would end up in prosion with much much more years of
service. The old people would not hesistate to kill innocent
whistleblowers (m46). Eg. the kids movie "caspar" unfortunately even
canonizes that.
