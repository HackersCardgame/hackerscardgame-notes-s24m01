Patients that takes their drugs tend to be
remote controlled. The algorithm that
controles them seems to learn and adapt the
places where i try to hide so that i can work
without beeing bugged.

In Konigsfelden they always know where the
patients are, otherwise they could not bug me
permanently. Maybe eyel card or_ maybe
something like implanted RFID and the uplink
eg. the fire alarm system. Unfortunately
tempering with the fire alarm system would be
a really really bad idea, but maybe we could
order the same system as they have here in
KOnigsfelden to temper with... worst case
it's not a default system and hasâ€™ unknown
addons, in that case i guess in the Workshop
near the railways, they maybe have some
unused parts...
