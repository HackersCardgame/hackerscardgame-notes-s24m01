Many things can be implemented as game.
E.g

Satan knows this principle to upload content to the brain of
people too. For example the games to blow up things (even if
only virtually) are maybe not the best type of gamification.
Best Case it would just be a stupid game, worst case it would
have an effect on the real world and maybe even kills
people. There is also something in between, where the kid
then would blow up something

. This would have at
least two effects on the kid, he would feel guilty and could be
blackmailed with that event, even he is not the cause, used
to dissociate and then boss around the kid with "his" deed. It
gets really complicated, when satan puts bad games
functions into good games, if the kid is verbose it's easier to
debug, but the kid then also has a bigger attacking surface,
