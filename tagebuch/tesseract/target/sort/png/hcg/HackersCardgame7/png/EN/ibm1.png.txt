If one would find the older people that bought eg. an
IBM System 3850 in the early days of modern
computing, we could maybe find out who did all this
bad things that happens in the world today.
Psychological Profile of such a person would match
to rich people and therefor maybe also not the nicest
people. But remember this would only be the first
guess. If i would be rich i would give all my money to
save the world, since there are still many problems
on this world i bet i am not completely wrong with
my first guess.

unknown: IBM had a "maybe" a few
