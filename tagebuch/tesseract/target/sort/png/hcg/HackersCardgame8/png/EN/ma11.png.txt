RUNNING A MASSIVE DISTRIBUTED
COMPUTING PROJECT THAT SIMULATES
TRILLIONS AND TRILLIONS OF
TAMAGOTCHIS AND KEEPS THEM

Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~????
The Borg Hive with their borg-cubes (Sspace-ships)
that look somehow similar like ql card is maybe not
evil as shown in Star Trek. Or at least you could
implement a good borg collective like Jeroen
Domburg in his Tamagotchi Singularity (https://

So the question would be why did Star Trek discredit
those cubes as collectively bad and why they are
showing the Federation (that is a military system) as
the good people, with weapons, uniforms, hierarchy

thats the reason why we question the view of
Eugene Wesley ,Geneâ€œ Roddenberry.
