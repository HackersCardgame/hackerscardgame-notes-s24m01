You can do easy for example create a ROT13 encryption, that
of course can be broken in seconds, but to begin with crypto
it's maybe a good excercise, then continue maybe with
Vigenére cipher, and then p-boxes and s-boxes.
Be careful, if you begin with crypto eg your local military would
like to own you and to prevent that you dont join the crypto-
anarchy movement.
Work in pairs of at least 2 people, If they want to put you in
mental institution to erase your brain you have better chances
to prevent that.

i dont have a lot of time *INSERT: since they target me
permantly* <- psychological warfare but if you have time it's
quit easy to write something to encrypt and decrypt rot13,
alphabet has 26 letters, so if you double-red13 you have again
the original...
