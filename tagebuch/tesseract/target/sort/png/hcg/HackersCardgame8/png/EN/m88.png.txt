Inventor:

Big System-Changes in little time seem to cause problems. For
example if you would have mos2 / mos3 malware cards installed
on the whole and one would just leak the whole blueprints how
this system works, to stop it, it would drive the criminals run
amok or suicide. So do such changes slowly [dy/dt]. The area
below the curve (Integral J) would still be the same, but the
chance that people guilty people run amok or even kill their
victims that they can not do a testemony is smaller.

The criminals use it exactly the oppostit way for targeting
whistleblowers, whitehat hackers, victims... they for example link
you with your equal aged alliies on the com-system (eg, t1) where
you have fun and are lucky that you are not alone, gives you full
communication with , they
recorded what you talked about, "plays the scenes in reverese",
especially that what helped you stable and feel good (m77 card)
and then start a virtual simulation (multiple t21 cards) that
destroys all these good scenes (m57 card checks that) and then
loop the bad things (t10, t23 t32, m54) and start (co6,a16, atl...)
