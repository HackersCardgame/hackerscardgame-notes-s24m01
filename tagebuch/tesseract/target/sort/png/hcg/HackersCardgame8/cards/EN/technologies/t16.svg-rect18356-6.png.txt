TAVenEOR: Romans

Etymologically, the term police is derived from the Greek
TOAtc, polis "city". It referred to the entire public
administration (today as "construction police" and "fire
police") outside of Greece as the fashion word of the
Romans. Maybe abused as Chessman of the authorities,
and in many countries the police are the group of people
who commit the most murders. See also "Americans 58
Times More Likely to Be Killed by Cops Than by
Terrorists"
Violence, riots, sometimes conflict rather escalating,
often intimidating, biased often preserving only the
power of the upper class, we should teach all cops
(can you find the intentionally
placed bug in m55 card?)
