You can buy homeopatic devices "against" electromagnetic
radiation (see card e1, e2, e3, t1).

First a device that runs on electric power normally causes
more radiation and not less. But in my opinion this would be
that perfect camouflage for cyberweapons that emmits on the
frequencies of implants or goden wires of victims (e4, t19) this
would be offensive equipment, and would maybe obfuscate
that the electronic equipment that targets me is in power grid
equipment from EG ABB, Siemens and installed by the local
Electrician that buys it from eg. Otto Fischer ZH (m46 Card?)
