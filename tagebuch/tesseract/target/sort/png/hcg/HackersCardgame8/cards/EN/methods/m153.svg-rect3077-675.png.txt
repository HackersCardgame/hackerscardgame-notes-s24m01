Inventor: XXXXX Year: ~????
In case i would have found out, that they used her to make me
controllable with my love to her and i would write a mail that
this situation is the way the induce suicide they would "maybe"
tell the direct opposite, and that i would have raped her. People
would maybe not believe it, so they chemically castrate me.
That the do drug tests on psychiatric patients is quite normal in
switzerland as you Can read in the press.

To chemically castrate the victim would be suggesitve and
manipulative and would give the criminal following benefits.

- it would suggest that the victim is drive control criminal

-> no sex would maybe not be a reason to commit suicide

- it would be a mean chess move Below the belt, "hahaha"

-> victim-bashing would maybe cause another suicide attempt

- it would make the jury focus on the sexual things instead of the
18 years the victim was abused as slave driven by his love not
by his sexual needs. It's about truth, trust and the promise both
gave. Maybe this is a normal way to drive rape victims in
Switzerland into suicide, not sure so far about that...
