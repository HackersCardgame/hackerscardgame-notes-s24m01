If you need to punish someone then do it bijective.
Best thing is not to attack a person physically or in
the mainframe, or with cyberwar... you could risk his
or your life. There are seldom cases, for example if
they want to (cyber-) [ rape | attack ] your girl..., in
this case it is possibly ok to defend yourself and
younger against the offender. Keep in mind that you
defend yourself without causing permenent harm.
Maybe the offender is remote controlled. See cards
t1,...

If there is something like death sentence for
example in texas then and would kill an innocent
you would find that out to late, then the whole state
could sentenced to death to. In Switzerland there are
no official death sentences.
