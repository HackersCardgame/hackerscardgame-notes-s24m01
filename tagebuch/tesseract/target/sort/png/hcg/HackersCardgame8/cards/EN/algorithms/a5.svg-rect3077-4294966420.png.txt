Access-based Enumeration i Customize

Access-based Enumeration makes visible only those files or
folders that the user has the rights to access. When
Access-based Enumeration is enabled, Windows willl not
display files or folders that the user does not have rights to
access.

Depending on the authorization (or the security
clearance) of a user, folders are shown or not shown ina
Windows Network. The same principle maybe applies to
websites, youtube, maybe even gitub... if you look at the
m50 card the same system "could" be used to split
society into two+ separate groups, and there would be
even some triggers known to some of the older groups to
start a civil war between this two groups. Maybe to
explain Access Based Ennumeration+-+ to the society
would deescalate this problem a bit.So update your
people with this knowledge. | learned about Access Based
Ennumeration at ABB Technikerschule Baden, hopefully
the teach this function not for the dark-side... if done in
the graphics card or graphics driver one could manipulate
things even if he checked if the file was transmitted
correctly, so one need to print all evidence.
