In the preamble of the Swiss Federal Constitution is
written: In the name of God. We can therefore
assume that for everything that went wrong, People
produced an law article for, and over the years they
also produced laws and regulations that benefits a
single supplier or cartel for a specific application, (for
example, Swiss fire protection regulations)

And of course there are also good things in the law,
for example having law that specifies how bridges
should be built to prevent things like Ponte Morandi
(English: Morandi Bridge). Unfortunately many
people ignore the law that leads to many innocent
deaths. When Justice System is illegitimate or is
abused by the powerful, citizens loose faith in the
law that leads to more problems.
