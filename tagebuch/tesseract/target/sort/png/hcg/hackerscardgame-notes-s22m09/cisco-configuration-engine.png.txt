‘The Cisco Configuration Engine isa highly secure, scalable and reliable network management software solution
that runs on RHAT Linux, Solaris, or VMware. By taking advantage of inteligent agents inside Cisco IOS
Software, the Configuration Engine helps to enable the "call-nome" architecture. With this architecture, a new
device, with minimal and identical bootstrap configuration, can identify the location of the Configuration Engine.
It can also automatically connect with it, and ask for the correct configuration
