Pierre Bourdieu talks about Social Fields.

Social Fields have Members, this Members have so
called Habitus. Habitus is verbal and non-verbal
behavior that is transfered from Member to Member in
the same Social Field without realizing that it is
transfered.

Each Member has Capital, for example Economic Capital
is how much money a Member has. Cultural Capital is
for example the art skills a person has, social
Capital is eg a PhD Degree.

The sum of capital can be compared. Those with the
most of all types of capital are those that defines
how the rule on a specific Social Fields are. Often
these people make the rules that way, that they get
more money.
