Halli Hallo Ame Vogelgesang

Ich weiss nicht so ganz wo ich Dich einordnen soll. Du hast richtig viel Aufwand betrieben fiir den
Talk. Danke dafiir.

Dinge die Du nicht erwahnt hast und meiner Meinung zum Deeskalieren helfen wiirden

Inventor: 72?

TODO: Further research
Swiss Army has dishes to send data rather slow if
you read the specs over discance up to 50 miles.
‘They use the band around 15GHz (A = 20mm).
Equipment to measure such high frequencies you
need a device that costs ~20'000 sFR. Out of reach
for many poor people in Switzerland. As soon as
‘one would have an implant or only a golden wire of
the length of Am the energy would maybe
sufficient to induce SOmV that would stimulate eg.
the brain. If the implant is in the amygdala (b1
card) it would possibly induce rage. WARNING: if
true, you don't want to be the guy that found
that out, With similar technology it would be quite
easy to even force good judges to eg. extradite

Swiss Military
Mainframe

Year: ~xxxx
If t40 to t45 Cards can be prooven then it would be
likely that there is also a swiss army mainframe.
Maybe one could find that with an estimation of it's
power consumption. It is not clear to me or us, if NSA /
CIA (Card £35) should just obfuscate maybe the last
bastion of Satan, or if it is to train the people for the
Military. Train in military context context would
possibly mean to make them kill for example an equal
aged, seal that file and blackmail the trainee the rest
Of his live with his deed (see m37 Card). Some did not
kill, some are just scapegoat for others. Maybe we can
‘get them back to heaven. But if we would "play" "red
team" to this systems we maybe would produce lot of
colateral damage. We hope there is a way through
Denhag curt or amnesty to prevent them being evil

Loop Recorder
Part 3

Inventor: 22000 Year: ~277?
Like t10 or 23 a game engine (here Blender 30) is also
some sort of t7 Card, but it's not just a loop it are more
event-triggers (t14) or state machines (col), for example
if | leak about this sort of things a16 card is beeing
activated against me. They often use an event in real live
to create this story, you would focus on the initial scene
‘and the person instead of technology. And possibly with
Al { Deep Learning (a11 card) prerendered Al or genetic
algorithm that learns. The card is in neutral gray, because
you could use such technology also for good things but in
‘my case they abused it more like weapon or "white"
torture against me. that wants to kill. Book Erebos. The
algorithm would maybe also try to isolate whistleblowers
‘and whitehats that could be as simple like an inverted
FaTVSr Card (Alex Wissner Gross) formula, not keeping
all people connected but isolate some or even all

Crime Scene
3D Scanner

Year: 2???

If Jurisitcations use 3D Models for surveillance
of accused people one should check the
device and the supplier. If NSA/CIA uses
Scapegoats for things they have done they
would suggest local Juristications to do this
sort of surveillance, but the device and
infrastructure would be owned by the CIA/NSA
to make the local Juristication beleive that the
Scapegoat is really the criminal, First Problem
would be that the real criminal is still free and
planing maybe already the next Crime and
secondly the Scapegoat would then driven to
commit suicide and the jurstication could only

say: ir that the Criminal died” but they
would know that m37 -> dtl Card.

Stimoceiver

Inventor: José Manuel Rodriguz Delgado ~1950
“The newest versions Neuralink(Elon Musk, maybe HoneyPot) read
EEG data transmits signals to brain. Can activeate certain
functions in brain, wires in the Amygdala would probably cause
‘agressions (b1 card). Active community (tead only, and. non:

invasive) on Twitter: @Open8Cl. Even things lke drecty "builtin

Augmented Reality (Like PokemenGO) could be achieved with
Such technologies. There are maybe other ways
W02005055579A1, US4877027...(HoneyPots?). Maybe sold as le

30 GAME-ENGINE
(eg. CryEngine)

Inventor: Silas Warner Year: ~1981
Castle Wolfenstein (Muse Software) was maybe not the
first 3D Engine, but maybe it was the first enduser 3
Engine. Like a SkinnerSOX (t2 Card) but “innocently
‘wrapped as children’s toy that uses invasive (eg t1 card)
‘or non-invasive (eg t12, t8... Cards) technologies. Such
‘games can be unidirectional or bidirectional (eg. b4 card).
Similar to a network monitoring system possibly with
Plug-INs, which are partially not even accessable by the
User, or as a separate addon that just evaulates symbols
in the game (eyel card) or bigger things like Quantum
Inserts, Turbine, Tarmoil. Game, fun, therapy or "therapy",
‘game could also generate psychological profiles like BigS,
Mayer-Briggs or even MMPI2. For example | bought a
‘game, joined the server, saw the first enemy that had his,
back to me but i could not shoot him as a vegetarian,

Automation

Inventor

If a person has to do all day the same, itis likely that
these moves are burnt into his psyche (not even an
impimant required) If you would give a stimulus (eg. high
noise sound at 15kHz, 16kHz, 17kHz...) you could link this,
move to a stimulus. t2, 11, formula see m76 Card.

So it would be likely that not only people like me that
worked in robotics (t22 Card) are affected,

It would be the same like m70 card or in combination with
m70 card,

Loop Recorder

Inventor: Petron Corporation (1933) ~1952
‘An analogue continuous tape, where one can
record suggestions such as e.g. 2 + 2 = 5, which is
automatically activated at certain times. The
tape will automatically turn off after 5 minutes. With
digital Equipment (computer / mobile phone / IoT)
one can realize more complex systems. And there
are possibly also several different cannels, (see
cards t1, t7, £3, t12)

During the night: overwrite things (cOS card) or
learning things while sleeping, eg. foreign
languages, unfortunately you can also upload a
complete (wrong) world view to the brain, or
antagonizing world views or dogmas to split society
into two groups that fight each other (see card m50,
or eg. ma5 vs ma6)

Normally when TV talks about Motion

people you trust. If you tell eg the Police they just
diagnose you eg Schziophrenic and would put you in a
‘mental institution where historically a lot of such illegal
human experiments were made. eg. Burghélzl, | guess
today (2019) the abuse refugees? #VerdingKinder,
‘#Schwabenkinder, not loved Childrend (often the oldest
male), Soldiers, .. generally people nobody cares about,
‘we asa society should act and leak what we know about.

NeuroNexus
Implants

Inventor: josé Manuel Rodriguez Delgado~1950
Originally developed by Delgado, possibly been
enhanced "in secrecy” since 70 Years, placed directly
in the brain, and with software like OpenBCI and
maybe Deep Learnign algorithms possibly
recognizes even detaild thougths. (see Neuralink,
Elon Musk, HoneyPot) No matter how good the
encryption would be, if wires are mede out of
metallic wires all such devices would be vulnerable
to side-channel attacks [fc = 4/ n] if geometry if the
wires are know and there is a transmitting device
with enough power nearby, (unsure if t25 or t26 or
both cards) | tweeted to Elon Musk asking what he is
going to do about this vulnerability, but he did not
answer so far. Maybe just HoneyPot for older
technologies, and maybe Hashtags are filtered.

WHISTLEBLOWER

Inventor: 2277? Year: ~?7??
Instruments of power tends to be abused. So we can blame
the Instruments for not getting into trouble with the poeple
that abuse the instrument of power. Justice Systems,
Police, Guns, Tanks, things against the sexual integrity of a
person, knowledge, knowledge about crime, BigD:
‘Computer, FinFisher, physical strength, martial arts... are ali
instruments of power. Like almost everybody | also abused
ower since everybody seemed to abuse it. Parents are
also often a bad example where kids leam to abuse such
instruments of power. | was mostly the guy that was victim
Of such abuse so it was rather easy for me to change the
side: | began to confess all my sins, began to excuse and
help those that were my victims. Spiritually | feel much
better now. But unfortunately there are lots of older people
that not yet begun to confess, and they make me a lot of
trouble, see maa card.
