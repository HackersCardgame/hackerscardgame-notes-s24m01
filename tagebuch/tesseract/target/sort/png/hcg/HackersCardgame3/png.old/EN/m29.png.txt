Like a plush: to hug, pet and care for

Clinical use: as a coping strategy, e.g. you can
buy a shy cat for a scared child, which then helps
the child to analyze his fears without focussing
directly on his own fears, that then might would
lead to a thought blockade & avoidance behavior
instead of the things that caused the fear and to
analyze them objectively

Use Cases

As an ally but unfortunately also by some to mistreat
(Anononymous = Case Dusty; where | would expected,
that Kenny "learned" )
