Since the Roswell-Incident, the CIA not just started to
cover illegal Human Experiments with Alien Stories,
they also actively hunt those, who could be able to
leak details about the abusive system. In this case
"Man in Black" or "Enemy of State" (just outdated
technology Stuff so they gave it to the world and the
Farady Cage is not really a Faraday Cage...) greetings
to Will Smith, bzw. the movies are cool for young
boys except that detail :)

Use Cases

To gloss over illegal Human Experiments that went
wrong (premeditation), and because anesthesia
went wrong much more these days
