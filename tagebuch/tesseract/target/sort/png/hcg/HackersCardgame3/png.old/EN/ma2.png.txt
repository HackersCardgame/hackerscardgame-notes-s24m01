The Big Five Year:

Frequently archetype in US films, which then
corrects the Bony and Clyde archetypes, etc.,
would probably be something like PraCobs clever,
considering the number of death victims in
different countries, shot by shooting-policemen,

etc.

This archetype should at most add a few Sheldon
genes or nerd genes ...
