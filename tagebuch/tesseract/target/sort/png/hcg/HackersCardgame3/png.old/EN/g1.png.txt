Role/Archetype Built: 1990
LeChuck has the role of the bad guy in the Lucas
Arts Game Monkey Island™

This archetype is missing in C.G. Jungs Theory:
"The older bad sibling"-Archetype, or something
like a "evil father"-Archetype who often mistreat
others. Or the role of an "always drunken
father"-arthypus
