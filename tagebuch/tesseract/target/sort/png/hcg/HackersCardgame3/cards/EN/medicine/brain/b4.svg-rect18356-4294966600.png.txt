EEG Data (As Received)

Inventor: Year:

| did not find any image from such a device. In Psychiatrie
K6nigsfelden (P4) there is an EEG installation. They
measure your EEG with electrodes and in the same time
it produces flashlights with a stroboscope.

Unsure if that was "service" of
the mental institution and they just tried to find out my
perceptual threshold. The problem was that someone
used this scene on the street or in my car and also
flashed me, that revictimized the scene in the Mental
Institution and made me massive paranoid. | dont knwo if
psychological terror on the street was intentional or if this
was that just that eg the CIA stole the data and abused it
against me. Question would be, what could one do with
massive blade-server && IEEE1588, eg. tl card and a
techno-party where many young people go to.
