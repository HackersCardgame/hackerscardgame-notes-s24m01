LoopRecorder
Part 2

Inventor:

There seems to be a digital looprecorder where people
add good informations and after a while people begin to
fill the loop with junk, problems, revictimizing of things
they already did to the victim.

We are not sure why they are doing that, but it prevents
the Whistleblower or WhiteHat Hacker to leak things or to
fix bugs in software.

One possible reason could be, that people can eg. buy
timeslots on Marc jrs Looprecorder for advertisement or
for cyberterror. If you look at the Rawhammer Card of
Mind (co2), this would drive people crazy (satan would
insert m15 here to make you forget about the
looprecorder) or more worse, they would begin to run
amok or suicide. Possibly Quantim-Inserts, Turbine,
Tarmiol are used for this but not yet sure about that. see
