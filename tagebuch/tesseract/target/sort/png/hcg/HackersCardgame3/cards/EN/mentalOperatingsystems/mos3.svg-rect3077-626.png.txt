My would be a
almost coherent dogma room for lazy people. Those
who create those systems try to make as less mistakes as
possible, so that the members don't have to
otherwise they would

. But the creator adds backdoors and triggers
to the dogma room, so he can control and trigger its
members. There are antagonizing dogma rooms, eg. the
Nazi and the Jewish Science Mental Operating System,
they would be incampatible (m50 card). In my opinion the
Jewish Science Mental Operating System has less bugs,
but people with low intelligence would prefere the Nazi
mental operating system.
