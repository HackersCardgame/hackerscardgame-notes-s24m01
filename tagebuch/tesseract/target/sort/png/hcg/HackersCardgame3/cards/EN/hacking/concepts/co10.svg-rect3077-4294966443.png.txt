PreRendered
Destruction

Inventor:
They seem to know every cable in my local Network, and
they put some sort of traps (Eventtriger) on my
equipment to destroy as much of my equipment. Eg.
making me pull the wrong plug, making me stand on
equipment. For example here they showed me eg. on t1
card that this would be the power cable that i

, but in fact it was the HDMI cable that was upside
down in my screen and broke the cable and even broke
the HDMI Port on my monitor. The " a
would prevent me from checking that, so the next time
when i would be in a hurry would waste my time. It is
very likely that they simply could switch of devices by
remote, but if they would do one would contact producer.
