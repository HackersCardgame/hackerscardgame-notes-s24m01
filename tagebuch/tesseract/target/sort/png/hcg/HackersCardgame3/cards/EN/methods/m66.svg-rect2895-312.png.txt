There are Mothers that force their daughter to eat
from the forbidden tree, there are also Vathers that
force their sons to eat from the forbidden tree.
Maybe there are Mothers that force their sons to eat
from the forbidden tree or Vathers that force their
daughters to eat from the forbidden tree.

There are also Parents that dont feel guilty, so they
would not have a reason to force their kids to eat
from the forbidden tree.
