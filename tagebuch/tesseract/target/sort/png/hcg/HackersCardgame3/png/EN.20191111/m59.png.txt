If a person draw symbols it's his psyche is mabybe beeing
scanned for vulnerabilities to later exploit them. The
drawn on the lower left "i" created in Mental Institution
(obfuscated by Movie "The Manchurian Candidate"?)
K6nigsfelden and shows my whole life since i was child.
One symbol for each scene i (or dataretention)
remembers. If you compare those with symbols of
Christchurch & brevik amok, one would maybe see that
mine is more analytical, where i try to find things out, and
the otheres are more of one symbol for PR / news. In any
case if such things happen there is possibly third person /
algorithm that influences. In any cases remove the
weapons, no matter if he / she would later commit suicide
or runs amok. Different technology Cards, O-day. If you
can rescue him/her "game" is not over, the person that
scans will just take the next victim!
