The main problem if chastity belts (no matter if real or
virtual) is how to get rid of them. Tools does not seem
to work here.

<unknown>unfortunately you can "not" buy women
chastity belts</unknown>

Braking up with the promis
man normally give their first girl could maybe help for
virtual chastity belts but because of the m38 card,
that menas if the JusPrimaeNoctis Suicide Death bot
was only virtually created software the girl i love and i
promised to be true forever would have the same
situation and then for sure it would be real. Can not
verify so far if this is real or virtual.
