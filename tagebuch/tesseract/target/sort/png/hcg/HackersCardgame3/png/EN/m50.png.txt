One can produce situations, where people are played
off against each other. You could do this with drugs,
for example giving one person chemicals that make
happy and funny and the other person chemicals that
make sad. Wirst case both victims will begin to fight
each other while both victims think that he or she
does the right thing. Maybe such chemicals were
involved in Stanford prison experiment, unsure. But
with Technology cards (eg. tl...) you could possibly
produce similar situations. Or in Politics, race,
gender, Nazi # jews... or with just showing good or
bad Facebook content (facebook experiment, see
Internet). For example also to tell some people that
the accused younger boy is guilty and therefor it
would be "legitimite" that an older person takes his
goods would create the same situation, the unjust
decision is often in favour of the stronger like Urs
B. that has weapons... NOTICE UNSEEN THIRD.
