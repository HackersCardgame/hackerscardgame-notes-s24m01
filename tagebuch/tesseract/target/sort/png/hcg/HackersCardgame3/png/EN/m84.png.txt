| guess there is some sort of electronic fluorescent pen whre
the offender can mark things in text | wrote. The principle is
quite simple, i guess one could make terror threat or a
death threat out of every single page out of the bible if one
would mark some words on the page. Not tested so far.
Workaround would be to use color your own in the text you
write, it then would still be possible, but much harder for
those that uses this dirty trick.

Technically one could implement that with things like tl
card, or if you would know how many words a person reads
per second you would for example send the word you would
mark with a high frequency sound just above auditory
threshold... or you could add a blinking effect around the
perceptual threshold, if done directly in the hardware,
garphics card or even in the screen it would be quit hard to
prove that. See also m85 Card
