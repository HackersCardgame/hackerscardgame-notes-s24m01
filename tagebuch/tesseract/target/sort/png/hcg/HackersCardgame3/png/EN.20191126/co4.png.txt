Inventor: .100xx ear: “ae

As a kid | pirated lots of Software / Music / Movies. So they
blackmailed me with that until i relicensed everything. As far
as i know i relicensed "Monkey Island 1" and/or Doom1 about
three times. After they could not blackmail me anymore with
piracy they begun to blackmail me with things that go
against my sexual integrity or they used scenes like "you've
just been poisoned" or “you've just been raped under
hypnosis" after all, i should not have relicensed all, because
you maybe feel bad about things you "stole" or copied, but
the other things drove me into hundreds of suicide attempts.
Additionally if you have prove for real crime or even
murderer and the accused would use this NSA/CIA dataset to
blackmail you, as long as you dissociate because of your
piracy-sins he will GISELE you but not kill you,
