Inventor:
Thanks to the guy who has drawn this, i really like
that image. Look at the al4 card. | don't think that
all witches are black, there are maybe also Fortune
tellers, occultists, esoterics, fairies, trolls, non-
medical practitioners, Satanists(?) ... So

would maybe cause more problems than
it would fix.
But giving the good ones that are not older than
1978 some cards could maybe help to find out if he /
she / it joined the or not.
