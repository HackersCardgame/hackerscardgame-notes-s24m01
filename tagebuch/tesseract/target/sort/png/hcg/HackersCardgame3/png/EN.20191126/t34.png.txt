aq hiding data
and evidence

Inventor:

As a younger person one has almost no possibility to
store evidence in a way the older criminals can not
find or delete. Especially if you would have an eyel
card they would know where you hide things. But if
you have for example a big library you could take an
SD-Card (i dont trust SD-Cards) or an USB Stick and
take of the housing, then you can put that in a book
from a library. If you close your eyes and select a
random book you dont even know by your own then it
is stored and even you would have to search a while
until you have the stick back, but the older criminals
would have to search too. If they know about that,
they maybe start to search too, but then you can
prove that they are actively searching for evidence, so
you can call the police and make your case.
