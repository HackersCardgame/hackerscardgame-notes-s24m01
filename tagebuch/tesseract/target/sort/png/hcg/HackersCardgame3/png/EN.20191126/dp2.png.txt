Inventor: Year:

The inventor of the programming language Smalltalk
was the first who used objects in software
development, But Gutenberg and the letters of his
printing presses was another example of templates.
A class can be a single template for part of a
complete software, e.g. "Name, address, location,
phone, ..." would be a template for a person in an
address database.

Simplification/standardization through "pre- printed
(software) templates", so in (especially
when they use things like tl card) after a while you
would recognize the general behavior of the class or
the design-pattern (dp4) that makes it much easier
to defend yourself against such attacks.
