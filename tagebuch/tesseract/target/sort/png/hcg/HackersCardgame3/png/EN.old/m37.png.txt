Inventor: Satan Year: ~??2?

The TV-Series "Bull" just obfuscates this dirty concept.
Mirror jury (represented by a mirror ball) would mean to
motivate young people to judge an equal aged kid. Worst
thing that could happen is that this equal aged kid runs
amok or commit suicide. Since the whole group said yes
to judge that equal aged kid, the whole grorup would feel
guilty (dtl card). Situations can differ: on the computer,
during a party, during s√©ance... but if the (falsely)
accused survives, there will be a part 2. (see fr-093 with
al15 card!). If only one singe equal aged to kill
that equal aged the older generation has one big
problem: that did not vote to kill
