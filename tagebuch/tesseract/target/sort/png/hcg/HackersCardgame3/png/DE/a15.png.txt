If you need to punish someone then do it bijective.
Best thing is not to attack a person physically or in
the mainframe, you could risk his or your life. There
are seldom cases, for example if they want to
(cyber-)rape you, in this case it is possibly ok to
defend yourself against the offender. Keep in mind
that you defend yourself without causing permenent
harm. Maybe the offender is remote controlled.

Use Cases

If you have death sentence like texas then and you
would kill someone and later you find out that you
killed the wrong offender, then the whole state is
sentenced too, and maybe also...
