One can produce situations, where people are
played off against each other. You could do
this with drugs, for example giving one
person chemicals that make happy and funny
and the other person chemicals that make sad.
Wirst case both victims will begin to fight
each other while both victims think that he
or she does the right thing. Maybe such
chemicals were involved in Stanford prison
experiment, unsure. But with Technology cards
(eg. tl...) you could possibly produce
similar situations. Or in Politics, race,
gender... or even just with showing good or
bad Facebook content (facebook experimetn,
see Internet) . NOTICE THE UNSEEN THIRD.
