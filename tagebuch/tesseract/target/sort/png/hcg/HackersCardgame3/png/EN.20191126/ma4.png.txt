Captive
(The Recruit)

Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~????
Gifted, held in prison to make him and the others
fear. In this case, Colin James Farrell, who
presumably was identified in psychology tests as a
man "who will once make trouble". For example in a
test like mmpi2 the parameter "feels responsible to
leak the truth to the societey" would stand out. For
the Mates it is Psychological even more worse to see
how he is tortured. Beeing the one that is beeing
tortured becomes normal after a while. But the
mates should stand up and say "stop that torture",
but those who would stand up would possibly be
upgraded to a captive too...
