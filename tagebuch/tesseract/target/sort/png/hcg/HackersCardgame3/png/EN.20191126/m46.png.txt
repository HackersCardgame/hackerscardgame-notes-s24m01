threat with
weapons

Inventor:

Often the offenders say that they would attack me
with weapons or things like al16 card.

After a while they begun to craft this card with m42
card and then calling me the offender to use eg the
justice system to hide what they have done to me or
us.

often combined with t10 card that perameanently
loops the phrase "fu** you du scheiss wixer" with eg
t12 card as communication channel.

My answer is "not in our name" AND "es gilt die
Unschuldsvermutung", since i say this about 100
times every day i made this card, to save time i now
will just say m46-card (thas this card)
