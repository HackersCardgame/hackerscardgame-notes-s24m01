Inventor:

Eg. the flat-earth theory is just stupid, or maybe just
a parable for Terry Pratchet's discworld novels, which
tries to explain small and big kids in an
understandable way, how a_ social system
"university" works, and that some people trying to
steal the Boots of other magicians. Maybe it also
describes how Mainframes (Al's) work, in this case
the chained Octavo which contains 8 spells (access
keys). Or e.g. The librarian (Google) who has been
transformed into a monkey => see Google-Query:
Porn

Maybe you should read Terrys Pratcheds work...
