rmal Tarot lacks Technology, Method and Algorithm Cards. HackersCardgame are less Tarot Cards with magical power but more cards to lea
& teach & explain people one can do with modern technology today.

##H#H ***You should not play any card of normal tarot nor HackersCardgame***. For example if you would play "The Tower" from a normal Tar.

nd responsible for the death of two innocent people.

day this would be logged in NSA/CIA DataRetention and of course also in other BigData Systems and you would then be blackmailed with t
murderer the rest of your live. If you though play remember always to also play the **Reversibility Card** so in case something goes

wrong nobody dies, which technically would mean **that a medic is around the person you attack**.

nce i'm permanently under electronical-/psychological warfare **i can not check, if someone injected malware**, for example 0-day expl

nce this are learning cards you should print them out (./pdf/EN/A4/*) and cut them out. It will take about 1 Minute per card (300 Card
