The brain automatically says: pain / injuries are bad.
The brain tries to prevent the pony from situations
where it feels pain again, so the scene that caused
PAIN will be burned into the longterm memory and in
the future automatically avoided (avoidance
behavior)
Physical violence against children is prohibited by
Swiss Law but unfortunately still very common.
This effect is (ab)used in Behavioural "Sciences" = to
boss people around for "efficiency" reasons instead
of educating them. The consequences are often a
PTSD that maybe can not be fixed at all. So it will
continue to avoid the people that caused pain, but
has probably no PTBS if it plays with equal aged
Ponies.
