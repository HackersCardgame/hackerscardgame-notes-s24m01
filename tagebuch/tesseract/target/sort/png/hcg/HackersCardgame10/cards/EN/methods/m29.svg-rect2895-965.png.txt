Inventor:

Like a plush: to hug, pet and care for but more
interactive.

Clinical use: as a coping strategy, e.g. you can buy a
shy cat for a scared child, which then helps the child
to analyze his fears without focussing directly on his
own fears, that then might would lead to a cognitive
dissonance & avoidance behavior instead of
analyzing the things that caused the fear

As an ally but unfortunately also by some to mistreat
(Anononymous = Case Dusty; where | would
expected, that Kenny "learned" violence eg. from his
father, so in wirst case Kenny is a victim too, and if
Anonymous would have beaten the shit out of him
then someone maybe wants to play a dt1 card to the
whole anonymous crew, unsure so far)
