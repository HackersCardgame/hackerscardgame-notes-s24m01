Role/Archetype

Guybrush Threepwood had the role of the hero
In the Lucas Arts game Monkey Island™

In classic tarot he would be "The Fool"-
Card, actually too stupid to save the world,
but has non-normal-distributed luck and his
childish behavior gives him high values in
the mayer-briggs dimension "“agreeableness"
which would be perfect as a_ chessfigure
would of satan, admiting Guybrush is stupid
not telling that he can use him.

But ignore him, focus on the _ technology
cards that produces’ real three-headed-
terrorist-monkey!
