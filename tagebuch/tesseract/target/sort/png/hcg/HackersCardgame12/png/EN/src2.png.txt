In 1984 KenThompson was presented with the ACM
TuringAward. Ken's acceptance speech Reflections
On Trusting Trust (http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/ken/
trust.html) describes a hack (in every sense), the
most subversive ever perpetrated, nothing less than
the root password of all evil.

Ken describes how he injected a virus into a
compiler. Not only did his compiler know it was
compiling the login function and inject a backdoor,
but it also knew when it was compiling itself and
injected the backdoor generator into the compiler it
was creating. The source code for the compiler
thereafter contains no evidence of either virus.
