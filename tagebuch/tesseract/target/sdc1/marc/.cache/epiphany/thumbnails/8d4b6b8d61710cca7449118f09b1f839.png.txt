Why jigdo is better than a direct download

Because Its faster! For various reasons, there are far fewer mirrors for CD/DVD images
than there are for the "normal" Debian archive. Consequently i you download from a CD
image mirror, that mirror will not only be further away from you, it will aso be
overloaded, especially just after a release,

Furthermore, some types of images are not available as full iso downloads because
there is not enough space on our servers to host them.

f course, a "normal" Debian mirror does not carry any CD/DVD images, so how can jigdo
‘download them there? jigdo achieves this by downloading individually all the files that are
‘on the CD/DVD. In the next step, all these files are assembled in one big fle which is an
‘exact copy of the CD/DVD image. However, all this happens behind the scenes - all that
‘you need to do i tell the download tool the location of a *.jigis" file to process.

More information is available from the jiado homepage. Volunteers willing to help with
Jigdo development are always welcome!

How to download an image with jigdo

+ Download a package containing jsgdo-1ite, This Is avaliable directly for installation in
the Debian and Ubuntu distributions in the jigdo-fie package. For FreeBSD, install
from fust/ports/net-p2piigdo or grab the package with pks_aéd -r ig¢o. For other
installation options (binaries for Windows, source), check the the jiado homepage.

‘+ Rum the jsgd0-1ste script. It wll ask for the URL of a *.s3gdo" file to process. (You can
‘alco supply that URL on the command line If you like.)

‘+ From one of the locations listed below, pick the *. ipo" files you want to download,
and enter their URLs at the jigdo-1ite prompt. Each ".jigéo" fle corresponds to one
"420" CD/DVD image.

+ Ifyou are a first-time user, just press Return at the “Files to scan” prompt.

+ Atthe prompt "Debian mirror, enter either http://deb.debian.org/debian/ oF
hetp://Ftp.AY. debian. orp/debian/, where xvi the two-letter code for your country (for
example, us, de, uk. See the current lst of available ftp.xv.debian.org locations.)

+ Follow the instructions printed by the script. If all goes well, the script finishes by
calculating a checksum of the generated image and telling you that the checksum
matches that of the original image.

For a detailed, step-by-step description ofthis process, have a look at the Debian jigdo
mini:HOWTO. The HOWTO also explains jigdo's advanced features, such as upgrading an
‘older version of a CD/DVD image to the current version (by downloading only what has
‘changed, not the entire new image).

‘Once you have downloaded the images and written them to CD/DVD, be sure to have a
look at the detailed information about the installation process.

Search Contents of CD images

Which CD/DVD image contains a certain file? Below, you can search the lists of files
contained in a wide variety of Debian CD/DVD images. You can enter several words, each
‘word must match a substring of the filename. Add e.g. 1386" to restrict the results to a
certain architecture. Add " all" to see packages which are identical for all architectures.

Frequently Asked/Answered Questions
How do I make jigdo use my proxy?

Load the file ~/,jigdo-1ite (oF jigdo-1ite-settings.txt for the Windows version) into a text
‘editor and find the line that starts with "wgetOpts". The following switches can be added
to the line:

se Ftp_proxyshttp://LOCAL-PROXY:PORT/
e etp_proxyshttp://LOCAL-PROXY: PORT?
-proxy-user-usee

proxy: passwePASSHORD

Of course, substitute the correct values for your proxy server. The last two options are
‘only necessary i your proxy uses password authentication. The switches need to be
‘added to the end of the wgetOpts line before the final‘ character. All options must be on
one line,

‘Alternatively, under Linux you can also set up the ftp_proxy and http_proxy environment
variables, for example in the file sete/envixonsent OF ~/.bashxe

‘Aargh! The script fails with an error - have | downloaded all those MBs in vain?!

f course this Should Not Happen(tm), but for various reasons you may end up in a state
where a large *.‘+0. tmp" file has already been generated and jigdo-1ite appears to have
problems, telling you repeatedly to try restarting the download. There are several possible
things to try in this case:

+ Simply restart the download by pressing Return. Maybe some of the files could not be
downloaded because of timeouts or other transient errors - another attempt will be
made to download any missing files

+ Trya different mirror. Some Debian mirrors are slightly out of sync - maybe a different
‘mirror stil holds files that were deleted from the one you specified, or it has already
been updated with files that are not yet present on your mirror.

+ Retrieve the missing parts of the image using rsync. First, you need to find out the
correct rsync URL of the image you are downloading: Choose a server that offers rsync
‘access to the stable or testing Images, then determine the correct path and filename.
Directory listings can be obtained with commands like
rayne rayne://edinage.debian.org/debian-c4/

Next, remove the ". tap" extension from jigdo-1ite's temporary file by renaming it, and
pass both the remote URL and the local filename to rsync:

rayne rsyne://server.org/path/binary-206-1.40 binary-4286-1.440

You may want to use rsync’s --verbose and --progress switches to get status messages,
and --block-rize+8192 to increase its speed.

+ Ifallelse falls, your downloaded data is stil nt lost: Under Linux, you can loop-mount
the .tmp file to access the packages that were already downloaded, and reuse them for
generating an image from a newer jigdo file (such as the latest weekly testing
snapshot if your failed download was also a testing snapshot). To do this, fist issue the
following commands as root in the directory with the broken download: mkéir ant:
fount -t 1509660 -0 loop *.tap ant. Next, start a new download ina different directory,
and enter the path of the ane directory at the "Ales to scan" prompt
