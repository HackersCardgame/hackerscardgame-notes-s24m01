Installing Debian via the Internet

This method of installing Debian requires a functioning Internet connection during installation. Compared to other
methods you end up downloading less data as the process will be tailored to your requirements. Ethemet and wireless
‘connections are supported. Internal ISDN cards are unfortunately not supported.

‘There are three options for installs over the network:

Tiny CDs, flexible USB sticks, etc.

You can download a couple of image files of small size,
suitable for USB Sticks and similar devices, write them
to the media, and then start the instalation by booting
from that.

from various very small images between the
architectures,

Network boot

You set up a TFTP and a DHCP (or BOOTP, or RARP)
server which will serve the installation media to
‘machines on your local network. If your cllent machine's
‘BIOS supports it, you can then boot the Debian
Installation system from the network (using PXE and
‘TFTP), and proceed with installing the rest of Debian
from the network.

Not all machines support booting from the network.
Because of the additional work required, this method for
Installing Debian is not recommended for novice users.
For details, please refer to the instalation manual for
your architecture, especially the chapter “Preparing Files
{or TETP Net Booting”.
