What's in this directory?

‘These are files containing the installer and other software for the Debian GNU/Linux operating system. The files in this
directory are specifically for the andes architecture,

How do I use these files?

‘The files here are complete ISO images, ready to use,
Once you have downloaded all the ISO images you want, you will typically need to write them to installation media,

What size and type of media will I need?

‘The images described here are sized to be written to writeable DVD media at a minimum, but may be written to larger media
if needed.

For extra convenience, these images may also be written directly to a USB stick. So long as your computer will boot
directly from that USB stick, it should start the Debian installer that way. The first DVD in this set is also deliberately limited
in size so it should fit on a standard sized 4GB USB stick.

There are lots of files here! Do I need all of them?

Im most cases it is not necessary to download and use all of these images to be able to install Debian on your computer.
Debian comes with a massive sot of software packages, hence why it takes so many disks for a complete set. Most typical
users only need a small subset of those software packages.

Initially, you will only need to download and use the first image of a set (labelled as debian-soneening-1 to be able to start the
Debian installer and set up Debian on your computer, If there are more images available here (labelled debian-sovething-2,
{debian-sonething-3, etc.) they contain the extra packages that can be installed on a Debian system (as mentioned previously).
They will not be bootable and are entirely optional. If you have a fast Internet connection, you're most likely better off
installing any desired extra packages directly from the Debian mirrors on the Internet instead of by using these extra
images.

How can I verify my download is correct and exactly what has been
created by Debian?

‘There are files here (SHAS12SUMS, etc.) which contain checksums of the images. These checksum files are also signed - see
‘the matching .sign files. Once you've downloaded an image, you can check:

+ that its checksum matches that expected from the checksum file; and.
+ that the checksum file has not been tampered with.

For more information about how to do these steps, read the verification guide.
Only the first few images are available! Where are the rest?

We don't store/serve the full set of ISO Images for all architectures, to reduce the amount of space taken up on the mirrors.
‘You can ise the jigdo tool to recreate the missing ISO images instead

Non-free Firmware

‘This Doblan image build only includes Free Software whore possible. Howaver, many systems include hardware which
dlopends on non-free firmware to function propery so this build also includes those rmware fils for those cases. Soo the
Debian Wiki non-free firmware page for more information.

Other questions?

Seo the Deblan CD FAQ for lots more information about Debian CDs and installation.

‘The images here were put together by the Deblan CD team using debian-ed and other software.
