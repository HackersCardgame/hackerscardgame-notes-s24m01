indictment, and that | think is a really important point.

So the TURMOIL system is a surveillance system, and it is a dragnet surveillance
system that is a general warrant dragnet surveillance if there ever was one.

And now we shot the British over this when we started our revolution. We called
them “general writs of assistance.” These were generalized warrants which we
considered to be a tyranny. And TURMOIL is the digital version of a general writ of
assistance system. And the general writ of assistance itself, it’s not clear if it even
exists, because it’s not clear to me that a judge would understand anything that |
just said.

<strong>But they all know how to betray people, use eg. Pedophilia Article against
kids, an article that should in my opinion protect kids not sue them. And that they
konw how to use the machinery to manipulate the masses</strong>
