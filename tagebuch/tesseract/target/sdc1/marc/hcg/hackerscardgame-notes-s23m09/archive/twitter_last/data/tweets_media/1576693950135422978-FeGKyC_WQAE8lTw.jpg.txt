Abstract

"Brainjackng' refers to the exercise of unauthorized control of another's electronic brain implant. eee
Whilst the possibilty of hacking a Brain-Computer Interface (BC!) has already been proven in both

‘experimental and real-life settings, there ie reason to believe that wll soon be posible to interfere

with the software settings ofthe Implanted Pulse Generators (PGs) that play a central oe in Deep

Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems. Whilst brainjacking raises ethical concerns pertaining to privacy and

‘physical or psychological harm, we claim thatthe possibilty of brainjacking DBS raises particularly « Title & authors
profound concerns about individual autonomy, since the possibilty of hacking such devices raises the

prospect of third partis exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning the subject's Abstract
cognitive, emotional and mativaional states, However, althoughit seems natural to assume that

brainjacking represents a profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest that the implications of Figures
brainjacking for individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by

brainjacking often serve to enhance certain aspects ofthe user's autonomy. The difficulty of Similar articles

ascertaining the implications of brainjacking DBS for individual autonomy is exacerbated by the varied
