OB hi nakedcapitaism com’ appetba :
are able to control this whole system and then localize attacks in that process.

So that’s a pretty - pretty scary stuff, actually. And while itis a digital thing, I think it's important to
Understand that this is what Jefferson talked about when he talked about tyranny. This is turnkey tyranny,
and it’s not that it's coming, it’s actually here. It's just merely a question about whether or not they'll use it in
a way that we think is a good way or not a good way.

One of the scariest parts about this is that for this system or these sets of systems to exist, we have been
kept vulnerable. So itis the case that if the Chinese, if the Russians, if people here wish to build this system,
there's nothing that stops them. And in fact the NSA has in a literal sense retarded the process by which we
would secure the internet because it establishes a hegemony of power, their power in secret to do these
things. And in fact Ive seen evidence that shows that there are so many compromises taking place between
the different Five Eyes signals intelligence groups that they actually have lists that explain, “If you see this,
back door on the system, contact a friendly agency. You've just recompromised the machine of another
person.”

So when we talk about ths, we have to consider that this is designed for at scale exploitation, And as far as
Can tell it's being used for at-scale exploitation. Which is not really in my mind a targeted particularized type
of thing, but rather its fishing operations Its fishing expeditions. Its more ike (ERRERSEERES i you wi.
Andi ore cases, ooking sede evdere, that seems tobe what ts Targeting Musi, Tight 92,
because that's what they're interested in doing.

So that said, that’s the internet, and we get all the way down to the bottom and we get to the Close Access
Operations and Off-Net. Off-Net and Close Access Operations are pretty scary things, but basically this is,
what we would call a black bag job. That’s where these guys, they break into your house, they put
something in your computer and they take other things out of your computer.

Here's an example. First top secret document of the talk so far.

This is a Close Access Operations box. Itis basically car metasploit for the NSA, which is an interesting thing.
But basically they say that the attack is undetectable, and its sadly a laptop running free software. It is
injecting packets. And they say that they can do this from as far away as eight miles to inject packets, so
presumably using this they're able to exploit a kernel vulnerability of some kind, parsing the wireless
frames, and, yeah. Ive heard that they actually put this hardware, from sources inside of the NSA and inside
of other intelligence agencies, that they actually put this type of hardware on drones so that they fly them
