1.3B Worldcat scrape & data science mini-

competition
annas-bog or, 2029-10-08

‘TL:DR: Anna's Archive scraped al of Worldcat (the world’s largest Nbrary metadata
collection) to make a TODO lst of Books that need tobe preserved, andis hosting a
data science min-compotton.

‘A yoar ago, we set out to answer tis question: What percentage of books have been
‘permanently preserved by shadow libraries?

‘Once a book makes into an open-data shadow library Ike Library Genesis, and now Anna's
Arcive, i gots miored allover the word (trough torrents), thereby practealy preserving it
forever.

“To answer the question of which percentage of books has been preserved, we need to know
the denominator: how many books exist in total? And ideally we don just have a number,
‘but actual metadata. Then we can not only match them against shadow libraries, but also
‘create TODO list of remaining books to preserve! We could even start dreaming ofa
‘rowdsourced etort to go down this TODO list.

‘We scraped ISBN, and downtoaded the Open Library dataset, but the results were
‘nsatstactory. The main problem was that there was nota ton of overiap of ISBNS. See this
‘Venn diagram from our blog post:
