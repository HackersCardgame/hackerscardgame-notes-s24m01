The CPU ring you are referring tois likely "Ring 0" or "Kernel Mode.” In x86/x86-64 o
architectures (commonly used in most desktop and laptop computers), there are four
protection rings (Ring 0 to Ring 3), with Ring 0 being the highest privilege level and typically

used by the operating system kernel. Ring 0 has the highest privileges and direct access to
the computer's hardware and resources.

The graphics card driver is usually executed in Ring 0 because it needs to access and
control the graphics card's hardware. This allows the driver to efficiently perform graphics-
related tasks and have direct access to the graphics card's full capabilities.

However, the specific ring in which the graphics card driver runs can vary depending on the
operating system and architecture. In most modern operating systems and x86/x86-64
architectures, the graphics card driver runs in Ring 0 to ensure the best possible
performance and direct hardware access.

Ifyou need specific information about which ring the graphics card driver runs in ona
particular system or hardware, you should consult the technical documentation of the
operating system or the graphics card driver itself. This information can vary depending on
the hardware and software configuration.
