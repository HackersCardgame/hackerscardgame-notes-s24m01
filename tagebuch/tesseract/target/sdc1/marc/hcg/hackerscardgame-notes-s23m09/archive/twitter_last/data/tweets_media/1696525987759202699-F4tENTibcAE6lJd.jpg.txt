intelligence systems collecting data from the whole planet, everywhere they possibly can - I would go to
prison for the rest of my life. That's the balance, right?

Jefferson talks about this. He says, you know, “That which the government is allowed to do but you are not,
this is a tyranny.”

There are some exceptions to that, but the CFAA in the United States, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,
you know, it’s so draconian for regular people, and the NSA gets to do something like intercepting 7 billion
People all day long with no problem, and the rest of us are not even allowed to experiment for improving
the security of our own lives without being put in prison or under threat of serious indictment, and that I
think is a really important point.

So the TURMOIL system is a surveillance system, and it is a dragnet surveillance system that is a general

Okay, 50 now we're going to get scary. So that’s just the passive stuff. There exists another system that's
called TURBINE, and we revealed about this system in the Spiege! publication today as well. So if TURMOIL is
deep packet inspection, then TURBINE is deep packet injection. And it is the system that combined together
with the things - with TURMOIL and TURBINE you can create a platform which they have consolidated which
they call QFIRE. QFIRE is essentially a way to programmatically look at things that flow across the internet
that they see with TURMOIL and then using TURBINE they‘ able to actually inject packets to try to do
attacks, and I'l describe some of those attacks in detail in a moment.

But essentially the interesting thing about QFIRE also is that they have a thing thats called a diode. So if you
have for example a large number of systems where you control them, you might say, “Hey, what are you
doing on that backbone?’ “Hey, what's going on with these systems?” And they could say, well, you know, we
paid for access, we're doing this, its all legal, etcetera. QFIRE has this really neat little detail which is that
they compromise other people's routers and then redirect through them so that they can beat the speed of
light.
