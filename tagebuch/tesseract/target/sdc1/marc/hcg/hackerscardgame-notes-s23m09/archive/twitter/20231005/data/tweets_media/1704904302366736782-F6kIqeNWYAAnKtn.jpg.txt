tyranny, ana irs not tnat its coming, ies actually nere. 1c just merely a question about wnetner or
not they'll use it in a way that we think is a good way or not a good way.

One of the scariest parts about this is that for this system or these sets of systems to exist, we have
been kept vulnerable. So it is the case that if the Chinese, if the Russians, if people here wish to
build this system, there's nothing that stops them. And in fact the NSA has in a literal sense
retarded the process by which we would secure the internet because it establishes a hegemony of
power, their power in secret to do these things. And in fact I've seen evidence that shows that there
are so many compromises taking place between the different Five Eyes signals intelligence groups
that they actually have lists that explain, “If you see this back door on the system, contact a friendly
agency. You've just recompromised the machine of another person.”

So when we talk about this, we have to consider that this is designed for at-scale exploitation. And
as far as I can tell it's being used for at-scale exploitation. Which is not really in my mind a targeted
articularized type of thing, but rather it's fishing operations. It's fishing expeditions. It’s more like
Fishing crusadeceaanh will. And in some cases, looking at the evidence, that seems to be what it is.

Targeting Muslims, I might add, because that’s what they're interested in doing.

So that said, that's the internet, and we get all the way down to the bottom and we get to the Close
Access Operations and Off-Net. Off-Net and Close Access Operations are pretty scary things, but
basically this is what we would call a black bag job. That's where these guys, they break into your
house, they put something in your computer and they take other things out of your computer.

Here's an example. First top secret document of the talk so far.
