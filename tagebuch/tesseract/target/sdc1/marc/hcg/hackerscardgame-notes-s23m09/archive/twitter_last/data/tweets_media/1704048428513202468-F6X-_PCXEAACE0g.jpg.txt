It's a dual license:
Â« For people the same age or younger than me, ALL my content shall be free under GPL or Creative Commons License.

+ For people older than me: you will not even get a license if you would give me 1 Billion $ -> That's not meant mean; it's just that it
would be likely that if you read, scan, track record, and store and manipulate my content, then I would commit suicide.

In both cases, there are exceptions I named in earlier licenses explicitly.
You will only understand my complete mindset if:

+ You don't have access or even own a weapon, does not matter if Atomic Bomb, Tank ... Gun, Knife (maybe except a kitchen knife or
Swiss army knife for, e.g., fixing stuff like computers, toaster, sex-toys...)

If you don't attack people (especially not younger), whether physically nor verbally nor with things like Cyberwar. **(If you just
defended yourself, it is maybe okay, but if you agree for revenge, then they will blackmail you even if you only think of revenge,
Fuzzy Trace Theory, Neuralink, Big Data, Data Retention.)

Throwing stuffed animals is completely okay (be careful plush tux, they are aerodynamic so they lose their impulse slower and
hurt more)

If you try your best to avoid CO2 emissions

If you (you don't need to take an oath) agree to the Hippocratic oath

If you honestly try not to be ignorant to younger people

If you are not a pedophile, neither in thoughts nor physically

If you help to defend all younger people against cyberWar, Cyber-rape, or real rape... https://en.wikipedia.org

+ Ifyou respect feminism but also that young boys (especially in male-dominated economies) need protection too

+ If you consume such content only consume "kosher" content... (Normally, you recognize, if content was made consensual or not)
(I'm influenced by Pizza Gate and Adrenochrome Topic, that is just the nearest match young people find on the WW3 to express
that their parents are somehow ArrayList<curse_word_Nous>)
