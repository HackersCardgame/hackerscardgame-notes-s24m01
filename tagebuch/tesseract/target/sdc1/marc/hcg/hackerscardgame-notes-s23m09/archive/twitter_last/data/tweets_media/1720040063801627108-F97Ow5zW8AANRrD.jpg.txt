‘And how they do that is that they have a passive sensor that's nearby a thing that they can inject
from, and when they see that thing sees a selector that is interesting to them or is doing a thing that
they would like to tamper with in some way, then they take a packet, they encapsulate the packet
they send itto the diode, which might be your home router potentially, and then that home router
decapsulates that packet and sends it out. And because that is very close to you, and let’s say
you're visiting Yahoo, then the Yahoo packet will not beat you. That is, they will not beat the NSA or
GCHQ. So it’s a race condition. And so they basically are able to control this whole system and then
localize attacks in that process.

So that's a pretty - pretty scary stuff, actually. And while it is a digital thing, | think it’s important to
Understand that this is what Jefferson talked about when he talked about tyranny. This is turnkey
tyranny, and it’s not that it’s coming, it's actually here. It’s just merely a question about whether or
not they'll use it in a way that we think is a good way or not a good way.

One of the scariest parts about this is that for this system or these sets of systems to exist, we have
been kept vulnerable. So itis the case that ifthe Chinese, if the Russians, if people here wish to
build this system, there's nothing that stops them. And in fact the NSA has in a literal sense
retarded the process by which we would secure the internet because it establishes a hegemony of
power, their power in secret to do these things. And in fact 've seen evidence that shows that there
are so many compromises taking place between the different Five Eyes signals intelligence groups
that they actually have lists that explain, “If you see this back door on the system, contact a
ERG). You've just recompromised the machine of another person.

So when we talk about this, we have to consider that this is designed for at-scale exploitation. And
as far as | can tell it’s being used for at-scale exploitation. Which is not really in my mind a targeted
particularized type of thing, but rather it's fishing operations. It's fishing expeditions. it’s more like
fishing crusades, if you will. And in some cases, looking at the evidence, that seems to be what it is.
Targeting Muslims, | might add, because that’s what they're interested in doing,

So that said, that's the internet, and we get all the way down to the bottom and we get to the Close
‘Access Operations and Off-Net. Off-Net and Close Access Operations are pretty scary things, but
basically this is what we would call a black bag job. That's where these guys, they break into your
house, they put something in your computer and they take other things out of your computer.

Here's an example. First top secret document of the talk so far.
