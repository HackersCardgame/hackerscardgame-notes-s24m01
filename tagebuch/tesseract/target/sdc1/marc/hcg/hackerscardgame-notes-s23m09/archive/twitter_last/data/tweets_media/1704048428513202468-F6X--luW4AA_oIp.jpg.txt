Landev's HackersCardgame License v1.0.0

IF YOU DON'T RESPECT THIS LICENSE AND YOU ARE OLDER THAN ME (1978), YOU WILL MAYBE HURT ME
OR EVEN DRIVE ME TO COMMIT SUICIDE, please respect this license.

This license replaces all previous licenses for all my works.

Satan tries to identify autistic people since at least 1980. He knows that they love to solve puzzles, and unfortunately, often such solved
puzzles lead to leaks. Leaks are good for normal people, but the criminals really don't like leaks.

If one solves the puzzle...

"Strategic Mission J (economic espionage) was already robbing Swiss companies in 1997, before 9/11," that solves the puzzle "Killing
millions of innocent Muslims was just to distract Europe from the robbery"

..they begin to do really bad things. They go against my sexual integrity, they often try brainjacking, and they also attack my imaginary
and real friends as soon as I contact them to create avoidance behavior in my friends from even talking to me.

All kids that are younger than I (1978) should not feel bad and are definitely not responsible for what the older people did to me and
are not responsible for these things. They even try to make autistics look like criminals, and if you are much younger than I, then it's
even better for you that you let the people think that you judge me. This hurts my feelings, but it's better than risking the lifes of
younger people. I stopped deciding things; I let the calculations decide for me.
