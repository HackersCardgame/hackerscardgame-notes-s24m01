Inventor: God Year: ~B.C.
German: Zuckerbrot und Peitsche. The Brain tells
"child", you have to eat that again (because sugar
has a lot of energy) so you want more sugar/carrots.
Unfortunately, it is also possible, to use the carrot (or
maybe money) to lead the child into the wrong
direction: for example, if someone would reward it, if
brother pulls the little sister at her hairs, this would a
bad stimulus-reaction-habit too. Parents who would
do such crap would deny the existence of Behavioral
"Sciences"...

You get sweets almost in every store. so the kid
learns early to comsume at the sugar-armed
salesmen that would argue, that he is Zacchaeus,
chief tax-farmer and would claim that he is entitled
take the money for carrots.
