*R

‘Where Vis the voltage, is the current, and Ris the resistance. Rearranging the formula, we
get

VIR
005V /6:22 x 10*-2 ohms
0806A

To calculate the power required, we can use the formula:

Power = Voltage * Current
005V*0.806A
0.0403 Watts or 40.3 milliwatts

Therefore, to induce a 5OmV voltage across a golden wire with a length of 2cm anda
diameter of 0.1mm at 30GHz, approximately 40:3 milliwatts (or 00403 Watts) of power
‘would be required. Please note that this calculation assumes a constant resistivity value and
neglects other factors that may affect the wire's electrical behavior at high frequencies.
