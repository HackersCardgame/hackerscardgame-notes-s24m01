And the FOXACID URLs, a few of them are public. Some of the details about that have been made public,
about how the structure of the URLs are laid out and so on. An important detail is that they pretend that
they’re Apache, but they actually do a really bad job. So they're like Hacking Team, maybe it’s the same

additional selectors that become available should you need them. So when we have a limit of an intelligence
agency in the United States, or if you’re in Germany or something like this, we have to recognize that
