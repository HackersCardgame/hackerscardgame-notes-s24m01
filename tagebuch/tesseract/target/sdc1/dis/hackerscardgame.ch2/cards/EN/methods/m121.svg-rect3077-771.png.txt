IMHO the criminals use Violence, Posion, Acid and such things to
distract people like me that asks "to many" relevant questions. if
i am confronted with a burned face they transmit a lot of
missinformation(s) that is "used" later to steer me into a wrong
direction. It makes also paranoid, depressed (m94 card) and
causes me to concentrate less. | guess they did this also
with the people that asked questions if i'm the bad guy, and that
led them think that i am the criminal, since they question me
and are "therefor" beeing attacked, then it would completely
make sense to belive that i am the offender or the criminal. But
just saying "burned face" = innocent would also be wrong, see
al4 card. unknown: at least 3 "use cases" for violence
a) violence against people that question a , would
make the scapegoat look more guilty
b) violence against , make him do mistakes
c)if a criminal would order violence against himself to make him
look more innocent
