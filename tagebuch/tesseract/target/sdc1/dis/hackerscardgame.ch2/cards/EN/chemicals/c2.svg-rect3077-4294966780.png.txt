Releases serotonin / dopamine, the unfiltered smoke
is bad for the lungs, the arteries... It is currently an
illegal self-medication. From medical point of view
without consulting a doctor it is not the best idea to
smoke weed. Because of the sedation the processing
of consolidation of the things experienced in his live
is skipped, which will lead later into a psychosis and
reduces the resilience of the individual. Often used
to obfuscate illegal human experiments for example
t* cards. Can have a pain-relieving effect. Maybe
helps against Epilepsy. Consumers show more
ignorance that can help in some stress situations
(but consider m49, m50 card). Additional the person
that smkes weed seems to focus more on the non-
verbal communication.
