The nucleus accumbens (NAc or NAcc), also known
as the accumbens nucleus, or formerly as the
fhucleus accumbens sept (Latin for nucleus adjacent
to the septum) is a region in the basal forebrain
rostral to the preoptic area of the hypothalamus.

â€˜The nucleus accumbens plays a lesser role in
processing fear (a form of aversion), impulsivity, and
the placebo effect. It is involved in the encoding of
new motor programs as well
