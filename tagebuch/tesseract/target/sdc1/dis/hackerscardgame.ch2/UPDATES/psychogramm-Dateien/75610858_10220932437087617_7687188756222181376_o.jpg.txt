Maybe "in the far future" we could be hypnotized by
2 QR-CODE since the Neuralink would dissociate one
by a specivic QRode. Calling one insane or
schizophrenic would maybe help to hide what they
have done to him. But on the other hand he is also
quite crazy. On the back of the ccd Sensor you could
wen have a small LCD for triggering things.
(Stimulus-Response-Habits), So if unshure about
that, CLOSE EYES WHEN TYPING PASSWORDS.
