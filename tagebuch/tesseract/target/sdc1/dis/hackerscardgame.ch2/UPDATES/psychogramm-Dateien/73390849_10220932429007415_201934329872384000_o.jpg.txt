As seen in Battle Filed Bad Company 2, the m-com:
Station is shown as small box, but it would be more
likely that these are big antennas like the one on the
‘Wasserflue® (in Kattigen near Aarau)

Maybe one should find out the power the antenna
uses and how strong the "drum-antennas” are and if
It would be enough power to activate implants
(maybe just @ golden’ wire with lambda/n_ (other
‘Antenna card) to drive people insane or even drive
