pamusb is on NSAICIA Huntdown list
braindet his is Jan 13

2021 GitHub,

ardi/pam _usb/issues/44

even if 'm completely wrong, pam-usb lets you sleep better, because you maybe feel bad if you have been owned, but you feel less
bad if you see that the other older people use really big tools, but they just use them, they did not develop them. So even when you
don't win the game not to be owned, you though will win the psychological warfare "game" since the other party uses products they
bought for lots of money.

My opinion: the NSA (technology) is just the support guy of CIA (that spin-doctos news, does mindcontrol or even overthrow
governments that is proven in many cases)

Ifyou can falsify my hypothesis and premises i would be happy, but as long you can not better think of mental institutions as some
instrument of mindcontrol, not for all patients but for some, CCC even has a notice on their congress page for getthing help with
mental institutions. And just btw Jacob Applebaum's Mother ended up in a mental institution too, that does not mean that she is a
great hacker like jake, but they go against your whole family, so therefor i question mental institutions.

in the end pam-usb is working on buster and bulleseye: https:l/github. com/braindefipam_usb/ but onetime pad not yet done, and
also not audited. | can write large C/C++ projects, but when it comes to such things i tend to get in serios trouble, and end up in
mental institutions, even when i was still using windows and the proprietary product Proteg (thats some sort of windows-pam-usb) i
had the same problem.
