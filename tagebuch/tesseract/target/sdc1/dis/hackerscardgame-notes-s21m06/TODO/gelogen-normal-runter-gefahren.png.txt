marc@debian:~$ sudo mount /dev/sdc3 /mnt/ -o rw
Windows is hibernated, refused to mount

The disk contains an unclean file system (0, 0).

Metadata kept in Windows cache, refused to mount.

Falling back to read-only mount because the NTFS partition is in an
unsafe state. Please resume and shutdown Windows fully (no hibernation
or fast restarting.)

Could not mount read-write, trying read-only
