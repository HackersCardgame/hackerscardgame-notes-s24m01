phone and you're wondering If It was secure - yeah maybe.
Good luck.

Here’s one where they replaced the hard drive firmware.

There was a talk at OHM this year [OHM2013] where a guy
talked about replacing hard drive firmware. You were onto
something. You were really onto something. Whoever you
are, you were onto something. Because the NSA has a
program here, IRATEMONK, and that’s exactly what they do.
They replace the firmware in the hard drive, so it doesn’t
matter if you reformat the hard drive, you’re done. The
firmware itself can do a whole bunch of stuff.

So. Here are the names of the hard drive companies were it
works: Western Digital, Seagate, Maxtor and Samsung, and
of course they support FAT, NTFS, EXT3 and UFS. They
probably now have support for additional file systems, but
this is what we can prove.
