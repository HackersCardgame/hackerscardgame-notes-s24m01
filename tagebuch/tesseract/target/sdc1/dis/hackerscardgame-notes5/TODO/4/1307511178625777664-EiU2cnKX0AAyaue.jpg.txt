Inventor: Petron Corporation (1933) ~1952
An analogue continuous tape, where one can
record suggestions such as e.g. 2 + 2 = 5, which is
automatically activated at certain times. The
tape will automatically turn off after 5 minutes. With
digital Equipment (computer / mobile phone / loT)
one can realize more complex systems. And there
are possibly also several different cannels, (see
cards tl; t7, t3; t12)

During the night: overwrite things (cO5 card) or
learning things while sleeping, eg. foreign
languages, unfortunately you can also upload a
complete (wrong) world view to the brain, or
antagonizing world views or dogmas to split society
into two groups that fight each other (see card m50,
or eg. ma5 vs ma6)
