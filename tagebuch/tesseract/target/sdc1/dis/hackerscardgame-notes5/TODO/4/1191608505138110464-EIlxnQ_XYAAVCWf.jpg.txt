In his book, Principles of Behavior,'13) he developed the following formula:
sEp = sHa x Dx V XK

Where:
sEg is excitatory potential (likelihood that the organism would produce response r to stimulus s)

sla is the habit strength (derived from previous conditioning trials),

Dis drive strength (determined by, e.g., the hours of deprivation of food, water, etc.)

Vis stimulus intensity dynamism (some stimuli will have greater influences than others, such as the
lighting of a situation)

and K is incentive (how appealing the result of the action is).{81l141

A variety of other factors were gradually added to the formula to account for results not included by this
simple function. Eventually the formula became:

sEa = VX DXKXJ x sHa-In- sla - sOr- sla

such that Ik is reactive inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that
dissipates over time),

sla is conditioned inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that does not
dissipate over time).24

Formula from Clark Hull describing how programm
Stimulus-Response-Habits. Today it is "possibly"
implemented in software. The sort of Deprivation or the
Stimulus would maybe change randomly. The
communication channel (tl, t... cards) are maybe
randomized to, like SE-235 frequency hopping.

Psychological dimension: things like exposure time, for
example 17 years torture or "white" torture after an initial
m38 card would be important too.
