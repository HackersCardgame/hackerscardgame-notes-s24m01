Protect younger people [edit )

One important thing is missing in Hacker Ethics: whatever you do, always protect younger people, no matter
what religion, no matter what race, no matter what skin color, no matter if right wing, middle wing or right wing,
no matter if male, female, non-binary, no matter if Little Pony or Baby Dragon. One can morally hardly do
something wrong if protecting younger people, and it would also be a mindset that would find global acceptance
and would lead to global coexistence. Protecting does not mean, that you later are allowed to take their goods
or their virginity, just because you helped. If you live that Categorical Imperative in an altruistic way it would
give you meaing in your live. 178.82.215.219 (talk) 22:18, 31 December 2019 (UTC) Landev FailDef (talk) 05:26,
