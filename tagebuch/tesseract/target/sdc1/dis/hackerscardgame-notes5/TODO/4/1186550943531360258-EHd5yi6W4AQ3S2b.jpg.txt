Inventor: Year:

The TvV-Series "Bull" just obfuscates this dirty concept.
Mirror jury (represented by a mirror ball) would mean to
E . Worst
thing that could happen is that this equal aged kid runs
amok or commit suicide. Since the whole group
, the whole grorup would feel
guilty (dt1 card). Situations can differ: on the computer,
during a party, during s√©ance... but if the (falsely)
accused survives, there will be a part 2. (see fr-093 with
al5 card!). If only one singe equal aged says NO to kill
that equal aged the older generation has one big
problem: The ONE that did not vote to kill will ask lots
of relevant questions that will maybe prove the
innocence of the group of equal aged "judges".
