Inventor: XXXX Year: ~?2???
They seem to stalk me 24h on my DBS /
Neuralink. As soon i find out relevant things
they hunt me down. Autistics love to solve
puzzles, solving one gives more information.
This algorithm also seems to work with
telemetry. one can carry about 5 things. But
they can force me to try to carry 10 so that i
get problems. They must give me relevant
infos because the autistic brain would not
accept irrelevant information(s). So maybe
paper and pen is my friend
