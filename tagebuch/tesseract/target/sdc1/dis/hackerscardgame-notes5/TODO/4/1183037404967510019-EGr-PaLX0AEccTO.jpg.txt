Inventor: Satan Year: ~????
Many Social Systems have a Gypsy Cemetery.
Initially there would be one dead kid, gypsy... Maybe
the one that was just ignored or forgot by the group.
Some older people used things like the m37 card
then finally using then the dtl crad. Even if the
group did say no to m37 they still would feel bad
about the death of an equal aged, also if someone
from the older generation pushed the red button.

An additional problem would be to have the next
"choosen one" as scapegoat "to protect the group"
so he would ask a lot of questions and then would
problably find out about that dirthy game. So you
would have a transitive situation where all the
older people would have to attack the youngest
asking [the right|to many] questions.
