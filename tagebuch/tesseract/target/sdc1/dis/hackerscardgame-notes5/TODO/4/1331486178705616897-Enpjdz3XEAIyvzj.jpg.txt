Hooves!

Let me introduce something
called "Granular Jamming." The
idea is that if you have an elastic
container (such as a bladder or a
balloon) of a granular material
(like ground coffee bean) then by
"jamming" the material together,
it becomes rock hard, but
normally, it's soft like a
marshmallow. The result is that if
it's squeezed up against
something, it will grip it by
jamming it in, and to let go, you
simply push on the bladder from
the other side.

This line is always
drawn when showing
hooves, so key fact:
Hooves aren't flat!

| propose that ponies, in addition to a hard
hoof wall, have inside it a bladder akin to a
balloon filled with these granules (a spongy
soft pad of tissue would work the same way).
Behind it is a muscle that can push on the
back to detach whatever the pony's grabbed,
much like pushing in the back of a suction cup.

Granular Jamming is a new
technology used in robotics.

Hooves are both hands and feet for
our little ponies. So are they hard
or soft?

The show has many instances of
hoof prints being left, and hard
"clod" sounds when ponies walk on
hard surfaces, implying a hard
structure,

But also, in "Magic Duel" Rarity
poked her hoof and it was red and
sore. They also seem to be able to
hold things in their hooves. So what
gives? How do they hold things? Do
they have soft hooves or hard?

The answer to both is simply, that
they have both!
