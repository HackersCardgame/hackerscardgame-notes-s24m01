Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~222?

Be careful and stick with equal aged. This image is from
~2014. They can induce such behavior. | guess they are using
Cocaine, but the Cocaine is in my opinion just licence-fees for
computational timeslots and malware on the Mainframe. Since
they just pay, consume and use it against me, they sure are
one part of the problem but they are not the intelligent part of
the problem. It would be very likely, that good people would
develop such malware to prevent those 1960s people from
using their real weapons. If they beleive that they are
powerful and could kill me if they just take enough of their
cocaine, they will not run amok against me or other innocent
people. The CIA PsoOPs induce suicide attempts (eg. with an
active denial system) to generate "legitimate" surveillance
warrants, but uses then the fact that he has access to the
victim to make it more worse. (even if urs & astrid would want
to "help" here they would make it much much more worse,
always bann people that make it more worse.
