Inventor: .1000x Year: ~?2?2?
Originally an implant in the spinal cord (medulla spinalis)
that could force an >>> orgasm <<< (they talk
expicitely about "sexual things" to make the people focus
on that tod Cele, and to GIES that t ole

)
erented 40 Jears later 1999 under Us6169924, Today
maybe encanced with more than just that "wire" (US
Army researches in this field) Output; the victim can be
"used" as a robot / soldier / killer or sex slave with a 3D
model of the victim in a 3D environment (like games) if
all people would have such thing they could create a
weapon out of such technology and unfortunately kill
billions in a few seconds. Hopefully those who created
this system considered that vulnerability. Mobile phone
could act as UpLink to a mainframe (the US Army maybe
uses the Cry-Engine with PhysX for the "Simulation")
