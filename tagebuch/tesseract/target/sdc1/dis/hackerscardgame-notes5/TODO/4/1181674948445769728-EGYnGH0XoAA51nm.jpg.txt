Inventor:

Maybe "in the far future" we could be hypnotized by a
QR-CODE since the Neuralink would dissociate one by a
specivic code. Calling one insane or schizophrenic
would maybe help to hide what they have done to him.
Bot on the other hand he is also quite crazy. On the
back of the ccd Sensor you could even have a small LCD
for triggering things. (Stimulus-Response-Habits)

Use Cases

Even if a medic does such things in hospital and
sterile, you could tough could loose permanently eye-
sigth. So maybe not the best idea.
