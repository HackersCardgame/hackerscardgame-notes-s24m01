Hi Guys and Gals

| would like to introduce the word #SyntheticBackdoor
“#Synthetic #Backdoor" or "#Synthetic #0day"

based on the same principle like the synthetic sensors [1,2] that more or less explain how
witchcraft technically works ...

OR if there is already a word for [3] i would like to know this word.

[3] social engineering is in my opinion not exact enough
