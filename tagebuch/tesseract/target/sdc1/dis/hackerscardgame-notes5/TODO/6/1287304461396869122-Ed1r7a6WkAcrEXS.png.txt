Fill device

From wikipedia. the free encyclopedia

Af device or key loader is 2 module used to load cryptographic keys into electronic encryption machines. Fill devices are usually hand held and electronic ones are batery operated.

‘der mechanical encryption systems, such as rotor machines, were keyed by setting the postions of wheels and plugs from a printed keying list Electronic systems required some way to oad the
‘necessary cryptovariable data. In the 1950s and 1960s, systems such as the U.S. National Security Agency KW-26 and the Soviet Union's iaka used punched cards for this purpose. Later NSA encryption
systems incorporated a serial prt fill connector and developed several common fil devices (CFOs) that could be used with multiple systems, A CFD was plugged in when new keys were to be loaded.
Newer NSA systems allow “over the ar rekeying* (OTAR),buta master key often must sil be loaded using a fill device.

NSA uses two serial protocols or key fil, DS-102 and DS-102. Both employ the same U-229 6-pin connector type used fr U.S. miltary audio handsets, withthe 05-101 being the newer ofthe two serial
fil protocols, The DS-101 protocol can also be used to load cryptographic algorithms and software updates fr crypto modules.

‘Common fill devices employed by NSA include:
+ 17%-28 pn gun used with the NESTOR (encryption) system
+ 14-13 Electronic Wansfer Device
+ 7x5 Net Control Device!)

+ KO/18 paper tape reader. The operator pulls 8level tape through this unt by han.
+ ANICYZ-10 Data Transfer Device - a small POA-like uni that can store up to 1000 keys

+ Secure D702000 system (SDS) Named KiG-20, this was the next generation common fill device replacement forthe DTD when it started production in 2006. It employs the Windows CE operating
system 2) ‘ARV device °

+ AN/PYQ-20 Simple Key Loader (SKL)-a simpler replacement forthe DTD.
+ KS0-68 Crypt ignition key (Ck)
+ Kik-30, a more recent fil device, is trademarked asthe “Really Simple Key Loader” (RASKL) with “single button key-squrt”t supports a wide varity of devices and keys.)

‘The older K¥K-13/91 E715 and Mx-10579 are limited to certain key types
