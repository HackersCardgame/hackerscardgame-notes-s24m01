[Ivo] already included support for custom skeleton definitions, as well as BVH import/export to use the
generated data in commonly used tools like Blender of Maya. The software portion of the project is
released as open source under MIT License, with both the firmware and the server application code being

available on GitHub. According to [Ivo], these nodes can be built for as few as $5, which puts them in a
sweet price range for AR/VR applications â€” or for making your own cartoons.
