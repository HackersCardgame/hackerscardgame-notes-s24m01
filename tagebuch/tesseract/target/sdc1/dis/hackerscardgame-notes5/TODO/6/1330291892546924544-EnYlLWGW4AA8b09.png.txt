Clark Hull found inspiration for his own theory of learning after learning about Ivan Paviov's idea of conditional reflexes, and Watson's system of behaviorism.'"*! He also was impacted by Edward
‘Thomalke, as he adapted his theory to include and agree with Thomnlke's law of effect] After Hull discovered his interest in learning theories from Paviov, Watson, and Thorndike, he dedicated
much of his own laboratory work to perfecting his own theory. Also, many experiments conceming his learning theory came from Hulls students, who carried out many different experiments in Hulls
lab after finding inspiration trom seminars and lectures in classes that Hull taught”)

Quantiication was a chief concern of Hul's studies, and he continued to apply this interest to behaviorsm. 1418] While interested inthe work of Watson, he was not entirely convinced. After listening
to lectures by gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka, he began to work towards a neobehaviorism.) His goal was to determine the laws of behavior and how they can be used to determine future behaviors.

Hull originally intended to make a trilogy of books on behavior, explaining social and cognitive behavior! Instead, he focused on continuously revising is original formula as exceptions showed up.)

Hull's emphasis was on experimentation, an organized theory of learning, and the nature of habits, which he argued were associations between a stimulus and a response." Behaviors were
influenced by goats that sought to satisty primary drives—such as hunger, thirst, sex, and the avoidance of pain. His systematic behavior theory, also known as drive theory, is that ofa reinforcement
system, which means that in learning, habits are initially formed by reinforcing certain behaviors. Reinforcement of a response to a behavior supplies an effect that satisfies a need. In other words, this
satisfaction of needs helps create habits out of behaviors. Specifically, Hul's theory posits that behaviors that satisfy needs, later described by Hull as cravings rather than needs, reduce these
cravings. He called this concept crive-reduction, or drive-stimulus reduction {19

‘Other behaviorists found Hull's theories to be too cumbersome for practical use, leading to his work to be eclipsed by Skinner.)
