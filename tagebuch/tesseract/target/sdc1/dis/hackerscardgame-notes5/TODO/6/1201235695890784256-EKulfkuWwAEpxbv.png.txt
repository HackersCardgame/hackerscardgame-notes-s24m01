Using the stimoceiver, Rodriguez Delgado found that he could not only elicit emotions, but he could also elicit specific physical reactions.
These specific physical reactions, such as the movement of a limb or the clenching of a fist, were achieved when Rodriguez Delgado
stimulated the motor cortex. A human whose implants were stimulated to produce a reaction were unable to resist the reaction and so
one patient said “I guess, doctor, that your electricity is stronger than my will”. Some consider one of Rodriguez Delgado's most
promising finds is that of an area called the septum within the limbic region. This area, when stimulated by Rodriguez Delgado, produced
feelings of strong euphoria. These euphoric feelings were sometimes strong enough to overcome physical pain and depression.(2)

Rodriguez Delgado created many inventions and was called a “technological wizard” by one of his Yale colleagues. Other than the
stimoceiver, Rodriguez Delgado also created a “SISMIEREE" which was an implantable device that released controlled amounts of a drug
into specific brain areas. Rodriguez Delgado also invented an early version of what is now a cardiac pacemaker.!2]

In Rhode Island, Rodriguez Delgado did some work at what is now a closed mental hospital. He chose patients who were "desperately ill
patients whose disorders had resisted all previous treatments" and implanted electrodes in about 25 of them. Most of these patients
were either schizophrenics or epileptics. To determine the best placement of electrodes within the human patients, Delgado initially
looked to the work of Wilder Penfield, who studied epileptics' brains in the 1930s, as well as earlier animal experiments, and studies of
brain-damaged people.(2]

The most famous example of the stimoceiver in action occurred at a Cordoba bull breeding ranch. Rodriguez Delgado stepped into the
ring with a bull which had had a stimoceiver implanted within its brain. The bull charged Delgado, who pressed a remote control button
which caused the bull to stop its charge. Always one for theatrics, he taped this stunt and it can be seen today.'7! The region of the brain
Rodriguez Delgado stimulated when he pressed the hand-held transmitter was the caudate nucleus. This region was chosen to be
