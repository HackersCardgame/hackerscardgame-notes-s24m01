The TV-Series "Bull" just obfuscates this dirty concept. Mirror jury
(represented by a mirror ball) would mean to
¢ . Worst thing that could happen is that this
equal aged kid runs amok or commit suicide. Since the whole group
|, the whole grorup would feel
guilty (dt1 card). Situations can shia on the computer, during a
party, during séance... but if the (falsely) accused survives, there will
be a part 2. (see fr-093 with a15 card!). If only one singe equal
aged says NO to kill that equal aged the older generation has one
big problem: The ONE that did not vote to kill will ask lots of
relevant questions that will maybe prove the innocence of
the group of equal aged "judges". Meybe+he-samte-as-—titee!

People like the m37 card until dtl was
played. They like because they are once not the person
beeing sued but the "cool" judge that is morally better.
Origins of this behavior maybe comes from the childhood.
