}S"= The Ken Thompson
Ph Hack

In 1984 KenThompson was presented with the ACM
‘Turingaward. Ken's acceptance speech Reflections On

Trusting Trust (http:jom.bell-abs.com/whoyken/trust html)
escribes a hack (in every sense), the most subversive ever
perpetrated, nothing less than the root password of all ev.

Ken describes how he injected a virus into a compiler. Not
only did his compiler know it was compiling the login function
fand inject a backdoor, but it also knew when it was compiling
Itself and injected the backdoor generator into the compiler it
was creating. The source code for the compiler thereafter
Contains no evidence of either virus

Ken wrote, In demonstrating the possibility ofthis kind of
attack, I picked on the C compiler I could have picked on any
rogram-handling program such as an assembler, a loader, or
even hardware microcode. As the level of program gets
Tower, these bugs will be harder and harder to detect. A well
instalied microcode bug will be almost impossible to detect.

en does not mean bug in the sense of error, but inthe sense
of listening device. And itis “almost” impossible to detect
because TheKenThompsontack easily propagates into the
binaries of all the inspectors, debuggers, disassemblers, and
dumpers a programmer would use to tr to detect it. And
defeats them. Unless you're coding in binary, or you're using
tools compiled before the KTH was installed, you simply have
no access to an uncompromised tool,

In fact, given the amenability of microcode to the KTH, not
even then,

All manner of controls and monitors could be secreted this
‘way in the OSes of all the devices we all use day to day. It
Isn't very far fetched to suggest that the hack, in software,
can create an updatable backdoor. This way every plece of
software on the planet can be KTH bugged without any
possiblity of detection by any mortal engineer anywhere,

Well, maybe with the diligent use of an electron microscope.
Given last week's horrifying revelations concerning the US
