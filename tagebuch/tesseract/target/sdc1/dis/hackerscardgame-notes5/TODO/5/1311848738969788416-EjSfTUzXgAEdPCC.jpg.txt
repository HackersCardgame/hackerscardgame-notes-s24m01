They seem to play this card only if one have hardly no
money or spent last money to red cross for water in syria.
One buys food with last money, and then they activate a
old ugly Bot (m48 Card) that eg. touches food, on t1...
they say that a suicide death bot was transferd to your
last food. The bad thing is, if you then would eat this food
this lUea would ue activated. The only workaround i
fo to throw this food away. | guess this is
haw Hey inaeee ae people or homeless® people. The
victim of this cyber-attack would then maybe attack the
person that transfered that malware (m50 Card). Often
this sort of Malware spreads to your whole existence and
to many of the scenes and objects you own. | heard they
use same sort of DETR ee on womans underpants

er the malware back to the person who

t, but Gneducated ae would run amok.
