30 GHME-ENGINE
(eg. CryEngine)

Dr B.F. Skinner

Inventor:

Castle Wolfenstein (Muse Software) was maybe not the
first 3D Engine, but maybe it was the first enduser 3D
Engine. Like a (t2 Card) but "innocently"
wrapped as children's toy that uses (eg tl card)
or non-invasive (eg t12, t8... Cards) technologies. Such
games can be unidirectional or bidirectional (eg. b4 card).
Similar to a network monitoring system possibly with
Plug-INs, which are partially not even accessable by the
user, or as a separate addon that just evaulates symbols
in the game (eyel card) or bigger things like

. Game, fun, therapy or "therapy",
game

. For example i bought a

game, joined the server, saw the first enemy that had his
back to me but i could not shoot him as a vegetarian.
