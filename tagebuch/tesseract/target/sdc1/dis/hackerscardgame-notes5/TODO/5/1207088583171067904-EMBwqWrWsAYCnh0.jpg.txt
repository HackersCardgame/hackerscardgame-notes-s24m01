3 December 1956 Wolff wrote

a copy of the mailing list for Mead’s

Institute for Intercultural Studies (IFIS) (MM C37 HW to
MM 12/3/56). Wolff wrote that he ‘would like to bring to

The Society for the Investigation of Human Ecology
funded anthropological and sociological projects providing
specific cultural information about Cold War enemy popu-
lations, such as China or Russia, as well as research into
sexuality (both pleasure and pain were areas of interest
for those studying interrogation), stress, and refugees
(see Price 1998). The diversity in these different research
projects made it difficult to discern a simple pattern indi-
cating the CIA's interests. Some anthropologists were
clearly lied to about the uses and purpose of their research.
John Marks found documents indicating that when Cornell
University had hired an anthropologist before learning
that the CIA security office would not give her clearance,
[Harold] Wolff simply lied to her about where the money
came from’ (Marks 1979: 150-151).

internal report clearly states that some MK-Ultra funded

projects sometimes had additional benefits. John Marks

noted that ‘a [Technical Services Staff] source explains that

1979: 160).

The Human Ecology Fund funded former British
Nigerian colonial psychiatrist Raymond Prince to travel to
Nigeria to undertake ‘transcultural psychological studies
in the late 1950s. Prince had no knowledge of the CIA’s
funding of this research (see HEF 1963 and Prince 1962a,
1962b, 1963). Decades after the fact, Prince came to
believe that his cross-cultural psychological research and
filmmaking was funded not only to establish legitimacy
for the Human Ecology Fund, but also to attempt to recruit
foreign nationals into the CIA and ‘to collect psychocul-
tural data on cultures and countries of interest to the CIA
for psychological warfare purposes’ (Prince 1995: 407).
ACIA document declassified in 1977 clarified that unbe-
knownst to Prince, the CIA’s view was that his

study will add somewhat to our understanding of native Yoruba
psychiatry including the use of drugs, many of which are
unknown or not much used by Western practitioners. It will
also assist in the identification of promising young [deleted
