| did not really knew, that :

network, i heard that but it was ust Bees i
heard. In 2013 the Schulkommandant of Waffenplatz
Wangen materialized at Schachenallee where i had a
job at PrimeVision AG. | normlly went outside to
smoke a cigaret (smokel card). | begun to talk with
him and i used some sort of Social Engineering: |
asked "What are the fiber networks of the army used
for" (i did not knew that they really exist) then he just
made two mistakes in one sentece: "They are used
for the Marschbefehle". First he told me: "Yes there
are army fiber Networks in switzerland" second he
does not seem to be a gifted liar: "Marschbefehle are
more or less small Word documents... maybe they
use it for something else... i again ended up in m19.
