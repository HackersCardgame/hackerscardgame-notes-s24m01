An urban legend explains, that if you put monkeys into a room with
bananas on top of a ladder and punish the whole group (Behavioral
Sciences, non-consensual) if one of them wants to get a banana
after 1000 repetitions the monkeys then would attack that monkey
that tries to get a banana. If you project this behavior to Foucaults
Dispositiv (see German Article: Innerhalb Foucaults Theorie
gesellschaftlicher Macht nimmt die Sexualitat eine zentrale Position
ein [https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexualit%C3%A4tsdispositiv]) and
would cause pain to a group if one of them touches wiener (for
example with Big-Data, b1, tl, t12 cards) they would attack the kid
that touched his wiener. The Turtle comic (upper right corner)
would imply, that this algorithm even crosses the line of
generations. Crossing the line would cause the younger generation
even to commit suicide since this socio-psychology-design-pattern
then transmits pedophile parents that want rape the kids. If only
one monkey has a masochistic worldview this experiment
will not work. ICD-10 F65.5 declares masochsm to a
desease (Swiss law would allow StGB 59), that's how the try
fix that glitch in their mindcontrol System
