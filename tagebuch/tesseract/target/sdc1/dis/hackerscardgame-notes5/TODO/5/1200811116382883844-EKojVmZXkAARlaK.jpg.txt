An urban legend explains, that if you put monkeys into a
room with bananas on top of a ladder and punish the whole
group (Behavioral Sciences, non-consensual) if one of them
wants to get a banana after 1000 repetitions the monkeys
then would attack that monkey that tries to get a banana. If
you project this behavior to Foucaults Dispositiv (see German
Article: Innerhalb Foucaults Theorie gesellschaftlicher Macht
nimmt die Sexualitat eine zentrale Position ein [https://
de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexualit%C3%A4tsdispositiv]) and
would cause pain to a group if one of them touches wiener
(for example with Big-Data, b1, t1, t12 cards) they would
attack the kid that touched his wiener. The Turtle comic
(upper right corner) would imply, that this algorithm even
crosses the line of generations. Crossing the line would
cause the younger generation even to commit suicide since
this socio-psychology-design-pattern then transmits
pedophile parents that want rape the kids.
