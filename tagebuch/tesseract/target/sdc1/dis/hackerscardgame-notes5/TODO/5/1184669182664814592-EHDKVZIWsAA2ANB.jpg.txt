Depending on the authorization (or the security
clearance) of a user, folders are shown or not shown
in a Windows Network. The same principle maybe
applies to websites, youtube, maybe even gitub... if
you look at the m50 card the same system "could"
be used to split society into two+ separate groups,
and there would be even some triggers known to
some of the older groups to start a civil war between
this two groups.

Maybe to explain Access Based Ennumeration++
to the society would deescalate this problem a bit.
So update your people with this knowledge. | learned
about Access Based Ennumeration at ABB
Technikerschule Baden, hopefully the teach this
function not for the dark-side...
