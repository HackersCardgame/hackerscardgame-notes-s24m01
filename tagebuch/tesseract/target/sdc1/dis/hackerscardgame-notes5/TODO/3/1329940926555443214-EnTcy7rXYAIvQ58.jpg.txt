applications for wireless RFID chips. The pChip uses an external antenna to receive radio waves, which
can be transformed and wirelessly transmitted asa unique ID number.

‘The datas written during the fabrication process, using ROM, ands therefore non-rewritable, providing
a high level of authenticy. "By taking advantage of the merits of compactness, high authenticity and
wireless communication, and combining it with internet technology, the p-Chip may be utlized in a broad
range of applications such as security, transportation, amusement, traceability and logistics” - said
Hitachi engineers who worked on the project. Hitachi is continuing to develop technologies that increase
communication’ distance range and decrease antenna size, whilst preserving high reliability and aiming
for Improved productivity. The company said thatthe enhanced compactness and thinness ofthe new
chip has further broadened the range of possible applications, including gift certificates that can be
authenticated. The new REID “powder” can also be incorporated into thin paper, such as currency,
creating so-called “bugged” money.

Miniature RAD chips may also have advanced military applications such as smartdust. Smartdust isthe
concept of wireless MEMS (Micro-Electro- Mechanical Systems) sensors that can detect anything from light
and temperature to vibrations. Using a large amount of sensors is not a new concept - the US. military
‘experimented with this idea already during the Vietnam War (Operation Igloo White) While the older
sensors were relatively large and only somewhat effective, Professor Christopher Pister from UC Berkeley
suggested in 2001 to create a new type of micro sensor that could theoretically be as small asa grain of
sand, Research into this idea is ongoing and is being funded by DARPA (the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency).

What was only a theoretical concept in 2001 has now become a realty with the latest development by
Hitachi, and could find its way to intelligence agencies across the world. RFID chips are also a source for
Increasing controversy surroundingissues of privacy. An RFID chip can be used to track the location of
