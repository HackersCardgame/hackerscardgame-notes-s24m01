Deductive reasoning

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Deductive reasoning, also deductive logic, is the process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logical concusion|"

Deductve reasoning goes in the same direction as that ofthe conaitionals, and links premises with conclusions. ial premises are true, the terms are clear, and the rules of deductive logic are
followed, then the conclusion reached Is necessary true.

Deductive reasoning (‘top-down logic" contrasts with inductive reasoning (‘bottom-up logic") in deductive reasoning, a conclusion is reached reductvely by applying general rules which hold over the
entirety ofa closed domain of discourse, narrowing the range under consideration until only the conclusion(s) remains. In deductive reasoning there is no epistemic uncertainty In inductive
reasoning, the conclusion is reached by generalizing or extrapolating from specific cases to general rues resulting n a conclusion that has epistemic uncertainty] However, the inductive reasoning
‘mentioned here Is not the same as induction used in mathematical proofs ~ mathematical induction Is actualy a form of deductive reasoning.

Deductive reasoning differs trom abductve reasoning by the direction ofthe reasoning relative tothe conditionals. Deductive reasoning goes in the same direction as that ofthe condiionals, whereas
abductve reasoning goes inthe opposite direction to tha ofthe conditionals.
