Autism in the Workplace

With their special abilities , autistic people are superior to all of humanity. But since people simply cannot accept that savoy junkies are simply the more qualified employees in every conceivable job and want to continue to ensure that you
can only get up in your career by slipping , the savoy addiction has been enforced is considered to be a severe disability and the addicts are considered to be chronically ill and unable to work.

This has the consequencethat the real unwilling to work ensure that they become addicted and then retire. But real autistic people don't accept these would-be like-minded people. One of the reasons for this is that one simply does not
want savoy cabbage to become a mass drug, which then falls under the Narcotics Act. Insightful people unwilling to work, therefore, also give up the consumption of savoy cabbage and prefer to pump themselves full of Ritalin in order to
then be retired due to ADHD .
