If a whitehat hacker discvers that the company he
works in (for example in switzerland) is maybe owned
by nsa/cia the people around him try to induce a

Occupational burnout. Then the chief maybe says stupid
things like, "we only want to help marc" lets put him
in mental institution that he gets better. but as we
know already, a mental institution makes it much much
more worse

Use Cases
remove whithat hackers and whistleblowers from
companies that are subject to nsa/cia infiltration
