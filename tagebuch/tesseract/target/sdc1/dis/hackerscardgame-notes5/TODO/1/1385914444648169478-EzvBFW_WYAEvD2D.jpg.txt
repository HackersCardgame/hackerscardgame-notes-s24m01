‘Brai

jacking’ refers to the exercise of unauthorized control of another's
electronic brain implant. Whilst the possibility of hacking a Brain-Computer
Interface (BCI) has already been proven in both experimental and real-life
settings, there is reason to believe that it will soon be possible to interfere with
the software settings of the Implanted Pulse Generators (IPGs) that play a central
role in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems, Whilst brainjacking raises ethical
concerns pertaining to privacy and physical or psychological harm, we claim that
the possibility of brainjacking DBS raises particularly profound concerns about
individual autonomy, since the possibility of hacking such devices raises the
prospect of third parties exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning
the subject's cognitive, emotional and motivational states. However, although it
seems natural to assume that brainjacking represents a profound threat to
individual autonomy, we suggest that the implications of brainjacking for
individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by
brainjacking often serve to enhance certain aspects of the user’s autonomy. The
difficulty of ascertaining the implications of brainjacking DBS for individual
autonomy is exacerbated by the varied understandings of autonomy in the
