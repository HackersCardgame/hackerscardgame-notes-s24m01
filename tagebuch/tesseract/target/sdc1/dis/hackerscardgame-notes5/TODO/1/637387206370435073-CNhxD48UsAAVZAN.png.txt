I

wouldn't agree to watch anything through Netflix even if it were
Tunning on someone else's computer.

Also, I'd feel too scared of rushing abruptly into sex. I'd need to
get to know this women and develop an emotional closeness with her
first, to be comfortable she wouldn't reject me suddenly in a minute,
before I'd feel comfortable having sex with her. I'd probably suggest
we watch local copies of something and then have a conversation while
occasionally stroking each other's cheek.

If a beautiful bird suggested doing those things with me, I'd probably
respond similarly. The bird could perch on a sofa or on my hand, and I
would stroke its feathers however it wishes.
