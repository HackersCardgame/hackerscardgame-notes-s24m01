i need expert advice:

hypothesis:
with a needle array in the short term memory one could segment the short term
memory

whiteNoise between electrode 1&2 would jam segment (1) and therefor lock
segment(t)

t: would imply that there must be some sort of timecode like in #startrek

QUESTION:
is it possible to emulate such blindSpots in GANs / DeepLearning?

A) Needle Array

Ay in short
