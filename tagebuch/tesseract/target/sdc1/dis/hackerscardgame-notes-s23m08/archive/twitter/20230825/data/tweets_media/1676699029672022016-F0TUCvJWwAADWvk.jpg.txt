The new study allowed a glimpse into the internal processes of diffusion

Interpretation of the model from a biological point of view for the first time,

Researchers at the Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences at Osaka University
said they frst predicted a latent representation, which is a model of image data,
based on fMRI signals. The model was then processed and the noise was added
tot using a diffusion process. Finally, the researchers deciphered the text

‘them as input to create the final constructed image.
