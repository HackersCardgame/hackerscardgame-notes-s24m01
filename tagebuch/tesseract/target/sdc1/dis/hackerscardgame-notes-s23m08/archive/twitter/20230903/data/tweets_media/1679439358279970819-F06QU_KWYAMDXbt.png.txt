Itreally doesn't matter what you send, as long as the receivers find
it unwelcome. It could have been a photo, an invite link or a chain
letter. Please only send messages when you are sure people wont.
mind getting them.

Asa general rule, people dont like receiving unsolicited
advertisements, links, invite links to groups or channels, random
photos and, above all, anything related to commerce or promotion
ofany kind.

Hello Marc jr

I'm very sorry that you had to contact me. Unfortunately, some
actions can trigger a harsh response from our anti-spam systems. If
you think your account was limited by mistake, you can submit a
‘complaint to our moderators.

While the account is limited, you will not be able to send messages
‘to people who do not have your number in their phone contacts or
add them to groups and channels. Of course, when people contact

you first. you can always reply to them. 1229

Unfortunately, this is not possible. We are worried that we can't
guarantee our users’ safety from unwanted messages, should this
account be released again.

Remember that you can still reply to anyone who messages you
first. (Also: deleting and recreating your account wont help, sorry.)
