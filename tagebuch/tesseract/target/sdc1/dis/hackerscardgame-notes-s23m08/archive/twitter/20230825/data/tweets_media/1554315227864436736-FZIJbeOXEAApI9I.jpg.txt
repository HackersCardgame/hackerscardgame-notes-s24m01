CMOS Counter/Dividers

High-Voltage Types (20-Volt Rating)
€D40178—Decade Counter with

10 Decoded Outputs
€40228--Octal Counter with

8 Decoded Outputs

@ C040178 and CD40228 are 5-

stage and 4-stage Johnson counters having
10 and B decoded outputs, respectively.
Inputs include @ CLOCK. a RESET, and a
CLOCK INHIBIT signal. Schmitt ‘trigger
action in the CLOCK input circuit provides
pulse shaping that allows unlimited clock
input pulse rise and fall times,
These counters are advanced one count at
the positive clock signal transition if the
CLOCK INHIBIT signat is tow. Counter
advancement via the clock line is inhibited
when the CLOCK INHIBIT signal is high.
A high RESET signat clears the counter to
its zero count. Use of the Johnson counter
configuration permits high-speed operation,
input decode-gating and spik de:
coded outputs. Antilock gating is provided,
thus assuring proper counting sequence. The
decoded outputs ace normally (ow and go
high only at their respective decoded time
slot. Each decoded output remains high for
fone full clock cycle. A CARRY-OUT signal
completes one cycle every 10 clock input
cycles in the CO4017B or every 8 clock
input cycles in the CD4022B and is used to
ripple-clock the succeeding device in a
‘multi-device counting chai
