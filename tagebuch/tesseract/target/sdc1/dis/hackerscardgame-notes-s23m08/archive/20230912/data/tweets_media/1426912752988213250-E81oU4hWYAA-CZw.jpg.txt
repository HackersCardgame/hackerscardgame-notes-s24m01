where they have a small device that they put in line with the cable in your monitor and then they use this
radar system to BOUifige a signal — this is not unlike the Great Seal bug that [Leon] Theremin designed for the
KGB. So it’s good to know we've finally caught up with the KGB, but now with computers. They send the
microwave transmission, the continuous wave, it reflects off of this chip and then they use this device to see
your monitor.

Yep. So there's the full life cycle. First they radiate you, then you die from cancer, then you... win?

Okay, so, here's the same thing, but this time for keyboards, USB and PS/2 keyboards.

So the idea is that it's a data retro-reflector.

Here's another thing, but this one, the TAWDRYYARD program, is a little bit different. It's a beacon, so this is
where probably then they kill you with a drone.
