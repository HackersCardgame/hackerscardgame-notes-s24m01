CHAPTER 9: Hear No Evil, See No Evil, Speak No Evil 97
Nonetheless, the United States seems to have ignored what was happening, for various

‘strategic reasons’, until 1988. Not only was Noriega's drug-trafficking ignored, but at the
same time the DEA administrators (Peter Bensinger, Francis M. Mullen Jr. and Jack Lawn)
and other US Government officials (for example, Attomey General William French Smith)
sent letters of commendation to Noriega - praising him for his work to curtail the flow of
drugs41! All agencies of the US Government were guilty of ignoring what was hap pening,
although the Department of State and the White House were the most active42.

An attempt to indict Omar's brother, Moises (a.k.a Monchi) Torrijos in f
trafficking was blocked and the indictment remained sealed until after the Panama Canal.
Tries had been signed in 1978. State Department officials, including the US Ambassador,
William J. Jorden, attempted to pass off reports of the indictment as false rumours, spread in
order to dirty Torrijos' name. Torrijos' point of view was recorded by Ambassador Jack Hood
‘Vaughn: ‘What bothers me the most’, Torrijos told Vaughn, 'is that Monchi is only shipping
five kilos a week. Why make a big deal of that'43?
