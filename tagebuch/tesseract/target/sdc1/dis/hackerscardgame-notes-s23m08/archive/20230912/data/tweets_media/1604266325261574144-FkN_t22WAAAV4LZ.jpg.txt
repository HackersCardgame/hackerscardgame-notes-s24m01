From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Hanlon's razor is an adage or rule of thumb that states "never attribute to malice
that which is adequately explained by stupidity."(1! Known in several other forms, it
is a philosophical razor that suggests a way of eliminating unlikely explanations for
human behavior. It is probably named after Robert J. Hanlon, who submitted the
statement to Murphy's Law Book Two (1980).{7] Similar statements have been recorded
since at least the 18th century.
