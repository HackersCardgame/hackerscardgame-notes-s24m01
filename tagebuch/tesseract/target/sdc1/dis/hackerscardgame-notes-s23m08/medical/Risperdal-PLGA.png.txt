Figure 9. Volumetric representation the inner part of one reconstructed microsphere of

Risperdal ConstaÂ® imaged with nano-CT. The left picture shows the X-ray signal in gray
nd the microsphere PLGA matrix pseudocolored in yellow. On the right, the small
lored structures represent the disper: internal spherical str S), which can
be attributed to the disper: of the
total volume of the particle.
