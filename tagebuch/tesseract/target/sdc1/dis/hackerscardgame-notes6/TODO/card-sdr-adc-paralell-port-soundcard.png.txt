BLINDINGLY FAST ADC FOR
YOUR BEAGLEBONE

[Jason Holt] wrote in to tell about of the release of his PRUDAG project. It’s a dual-channel 10-bit ADC cape
that ties into the BeagleBone's Programmable Realtime Units (PRUs) to shuttle through up to as much 2820 SEAR OHY
megasamples per second for each channel. That's a lot of bandwidth!

The trick is reading the ADC out with the PRUs, which are essentially a little bit of programmable logic that’s | searci |

built on to the board. With a bit of PRU code, the data can be shuttled out of the ADC and into the
BeagleBone’s memory about as fast as you could wish. Indeed, it's too fast for the demo code that [Jason]
wrote, which can’t even access the RAM that fast. Instead, you'll want to use custom kernel drivers from the

BeagleLogic project (that we've covered here before), NEVER MISS A HACK

But even then, if you don't want to process the data onboard, you've got to get it out somehow. 100 mbit fya
Ethernet gets you 11.2 megabytes per second, and a cherry-picked flash drive can save something like 14-18

megabytes per second. But the two 10-bit ADCs, running full-bore at 20 megasamples per second each

produces something like 50-80 megabytes per second. Point is, PRUDAQ is producing a ton of data. SUBSCRIBE

So what is this cane useful for? It's limited to the two-volt innut ranae of the ADCs — vou'll need to
