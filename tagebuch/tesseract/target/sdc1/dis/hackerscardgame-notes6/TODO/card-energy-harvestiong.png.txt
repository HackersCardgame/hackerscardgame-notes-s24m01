WISP NEEDS NO BATTERY OR
CABLE

One of the problems with the Internet of Things, or any embedded device, is how to get power. Batteries
are better than ever and circuits are low power. But you still have to eventually replace or recharge a
battery. Not everything can plug into a wall, and fuel cells need consumables.

University of Washington researchers are turning to a harvesting approach. Their open source WISP board
has a sensor and a CPU that draws power from an RFID reader. To save power during communication, the
device backscatters incoming radio waves, which means it doesn’t consume a lot of its own power during
transmissions.
