Hello Universitat Basel

about 10 Years agc . told me that when the Syria conflict begun, that
there were some people that acted like berserking zombies. Normally People have
a value system and moral. So there must have been some sort of "preload". You
once told me about Julian Janes, i bought it but before i could read the book
disappeared. For Example if one would have some sort of Viagra (just an example)
Chemitrode that could be activated remotely and video snippets / data about less
friendly parents of the soldiers to intimidate their sexual integrity to destroy their
values and make them to a #HackersCardgame::scg1 NPC?

FUNFACT: while writing someone seems to dDOS me, never had 20'000ms Ping
lag ...
