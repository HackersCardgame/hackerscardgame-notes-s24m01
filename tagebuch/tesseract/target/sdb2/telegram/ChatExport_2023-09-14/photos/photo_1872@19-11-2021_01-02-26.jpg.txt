This is a Close Access Operations box. It is basically car metasploit for the NSA, which is an
interesting thing. But basically they say that the attack is undetectable, and it’s sadly a laptop
running free software. It is injecting packets. And they say that they can do this from as far away as
eight miles to inject packets, so presumably using this they're able to exploit a kernel vulnerability
of some kind, parsing the wireless frames, and, yeah. I’ve heard that they actually put this
hardware, from sources inside of the NSA and inside of other intelligence agencies,

iso that they fly them over areas that they’re interested

in and they do mass exploitation of people.

Now, we don’t have a document that substantiates that part, but we do have this document that
actually claims that they've done it from up to eight miles away.

So that’s a really interesting thing because it tells us that they understand that common wireless
cards, probably running Microsoft Windows, which is an American company, that they know about
vulnerabilities and they keep them a secret to use them. This is part of a constant theme of
sabotaging and undermining American companies and American ingenuity. As an American, while
generally not a nationalist, | find this disgusting, especially as someone who writes free software and
would like my tax dollars to be spent on improving these things, and when they know about them |
