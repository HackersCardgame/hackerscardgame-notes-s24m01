to the strony diferentated real letter representations, thus making psoudo-etters more prone
to errors and ilusory memories overtime and interference. However, our findings clearly show

illusory memories increases as the memory trace weakens, and this isnot (or rather, much
less) the case for other error.

‘Although predictive processing provides a comfortable framework with which to account for our
results regarding STM, we recognize that thera is already a vast Iteature about the theoretical
foundations of false memory in LTM. For example, one explanation for the occurrence of
illusions in LTM comes from fuzzy trace theory [47] [Al states that memory consists of two
parts a verbatim part, representing the exact memory input, and a gist part, representing the
meaning ofthe input, based on a semantic analysis. Could ll also explain the current
findings in STM? itis possible that the verbatim representation of the visual input isthe physical

mirrored counterpart should init false memories [43} Ths is not consistent with the current

that, atleast for memory ilusions in STM, very basic perceptual expectations can directly
shape memory representations. Therefore, based on these considerations we argue that Sil
