There is a silent war happening between
Psychopaths and Schizophrenics. We know that
the population numbers are very small for both
groups, however one group is more likely to
become CEOs (psychopaths) and the other is
more likely to become homeless (schizos).

This is because schizos are good at pattern
recognition, and can notice the psychos. Normies
are incapable of seeing psychopaths in front of
them, and psychos relish and dominate because
of this. Schizos are able to know them on an
instinctual level and suss them out in a way that
normies never could. Thus there is a constant
demoralization campaign against schizos from the
tyrant psychos, who seek to use the population
against their greatest natural enemy.
