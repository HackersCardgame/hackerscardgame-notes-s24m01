My Idea Is to use 16 binary outputs from the chip input to trigger the 16 channels. Additionally you'd use 16 + other 16 analog outputs to send information about the note (12 range parts) and
the octave (10 range parts)

T know this is possible because of this video: https: //www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSKBtEBRWis

What are your thoughts? What software/hardware woud you need to transform the brain signal to a midi signal?

‘A new era of electronic music production is ahead of us, and it would a good thing to develop this idea in the mean time.
