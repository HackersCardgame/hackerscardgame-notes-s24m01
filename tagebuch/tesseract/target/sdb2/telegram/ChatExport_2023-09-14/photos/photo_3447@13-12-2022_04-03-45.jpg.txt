From a legal perspective, the permanent surveillance of Assangeâ€™s
conversations with his lawyers and doctors renders any proceedings
based on information gathered in this manner irreparably

arbitrary. Under these circumstances, the equality of the parties before
the law simply can no longer be guaranteed. If UC Global cooperated
with an American intelligence service, this would fatally affect

not only the Anglo-American extradition proceedings, but also the
espionage charges of the US Department of Justice on which the
extradition request is based. Quite apart from that, permanent

surveillance and the associated constant violation of the right to privacy
is also one of the standard components of psychological torture. The
targeted person is deliberately deprived of the safe space of

emotional and identity. One-way surveillance through cameras,
hidden microphones, or spy glass suppresses any

privacy, somothing essential for preserving a sense of personal autonomy,

possibility of human connection, thus further compounding the ensuing
feelings of powerlessness.
