As seen in Battle Filed Bad Company 2, the m-com-
station is shown as small box, but it would be more
likely that these are big antennas like the one on the
‘Wasserfiue" (in Kattigen near Aarau)

Maybe one should find out the power the antenna
uses and how strong the “drum-antennas" are and if
it would be enough power to activate implants
(maybe just a golden wire with lambdain (other
Antenna card) to drive people insane or even drive
tobias moser to commit suicide with his military
‘weapon (as far as we heard)

NOT YET PROOVEN
