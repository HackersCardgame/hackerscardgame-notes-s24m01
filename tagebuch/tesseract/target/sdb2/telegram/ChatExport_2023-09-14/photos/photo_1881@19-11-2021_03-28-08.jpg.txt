On my balkony there seems to be an evenntrigger that is
shown on something like Stimoceiver or Neuralink: "Jump
Now". To prim

trigger my amygdala implant (b1). | often tried, but i had
luck so far, i not yet jumped, but almost. They et to
train this habit with cards t2, t11, t7, al6, m32,

one could knwo when to start this algorithm watt nae
positional data (eg GPS, m60), if victim has body
telemetry (2 RFID Chips or 2 resonant circuit in the head /
skull or retina CCD (a19), they could even calculate what
the victim is currently looking at to trigger this event
(t14). Maybe fear or faith (m57, m77) of the victim is also
added to this algorithm. If i have a spinalcord implant (t6)
maybe this prevented my death, but if this would be
hacked i could not even prevent my death
