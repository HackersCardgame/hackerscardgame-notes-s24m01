No, you guys think I’m joking, right? Well, yeah, here it is.

This is a continuous wave generator, a continuous wave radar unit. You can detect its
use because its use is between 1 and 2 GHz and its bandwidth is up to 45 MHz, user
adjustible, 2 watts using an internal amplifier, external amplifier makes it possible to go
up to 1 kilowatt.

Just going to let you take that in for a moment. [clears throat] Who's crazy now?

[laughter]

Now, I’m being told | only have one minute, so I'm going to have to go a little bit
quicker. I’m sorry.

Here's why they do it. This is an implant called HNesVASiSis9

|
It's part of the ANGRYNEIGHBOR family of toolsf

[laughter]

where they have a small device that they put in line with the cable in your monitor and
then they use this radar system to bounce a signal is not unlike the Great Seal
