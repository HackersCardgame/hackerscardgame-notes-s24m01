Hi #DemoScene
Hackaday Oper

ethodisch inkorrel
i need expert advice:

hypothesis:
with 2 needle array in the short term memory one could segment the short term memory

whiteNoise between electrode 1&2 would jam segment (1) and therefor lock segment(t)

t: would imply that there must be some sort of timecode like in

QUESTION:
is it possible to emulate such blindSpots in GANs / DeepLearning?

Inventor: :0000
Elon Musk says “we dont have enough bandwith to the
brain” but if you look at research tke “micro needle
array" then you would see, that one could create massive
Darralel Interface to the brain, We quess the design of
Elon Musk's interface is completely bad and that he even
knows that. That what Elon Musk shows in his. shows
