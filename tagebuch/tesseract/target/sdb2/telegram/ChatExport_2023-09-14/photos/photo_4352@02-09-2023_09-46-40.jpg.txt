â€˜ScZopHRENA WITHOUT ANTIPSYGAUTIC DRUGS &THE LECACY OF LonEN MOSHER

For over a decade Loren R Mosher, MD,
held a central position in American
psychiatric research.

He was the first Chief of the Center for
Studies of Schizophrenia at the National
Institute of Mental Health, 1969-1980. He
founded the Schizophrenia Bulletin and
for ten years he was its Editor-in-Chief.
He led the Soteria Project.

The Soteria research demonstrated that
there is a better way: A better way to
treat schizophrenia and other psychoses
that destroy the lives of so many young
people. The Soteria research showed that
the prevalent excessive destructive
psychiatric drugging of all these young
people is a huge and tragic mistake. The
psychiatric establishment was offended.
Prestige and Money won. Truth and Love
lost.

Supplements and Schizophrenia

In recent years a select few of my
patients have been researching dietary
supplements to help with the symptoms
of Schizophrenia, There are two different
supplements which have helped them
dramatically, one been Sarcosine and the
ther 1-theanine. The positive effects are:
|-theanine is effective in ameliorating
ositive symptoms and sleep quality and
arcosine reduces the general symptoms
f Schizophrenia. These supplements can
be obtained from specialist nootropics
and supplement suppliers like

PowderCity.
