to do these types of attacks, they've tested these types of attacks against botnets, and

that's the program you should FOIA for. We've released a little bit of detail about that

today as well.

And QUANTUMCOPPER to me is really scary. It's essentially a thing that can interfere
with TCP/IP and it can do things like corrupt file downloads. So if you imagine the
Great Firewall of China, so-called, that’s for the whole planet. Sfeii GUNS NET er i}

But, yeah. Back here in reality, that to me is a really scary thing, especially because
‘one of the ways that they are able to have this capability, as | mentioned, is these

in order to reposition and to gain a capability inside of an area where they actually
have no legitimacy inside of that area. That to me suggests it is not only heavy-
handed, that they have probably some tools to do that. You see where I’m going with
this.

Well, QUANTUMINSERTION, this is also an important point, because this is what was

used against Belgacom, this is what's used by a whole number of unfortunately

players in the game where basically what they do is they inject a packet. So you have
