Our culture has made you believe this
is complex. Overly complex. So you
believe you need complex solutions.

Words have power and you’ve been
programmed to believe this is
challenging and this is difficult... and
then you recreate that challenge and
difficulty.

If we’re not careful society programs
your life for you...
