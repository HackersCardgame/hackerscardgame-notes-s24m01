Here's one where they replaced the hard drive firmware.

There was a talk at OHM this year [OHM2013] where a guy talked about replacing
hard drive firmware. You were onto something. You were really onto something.
Whoever you are, you were onto something. Because the NSA has a program here,
IRATEMONK, and that's exactly what they do. They replace the firmware in the hard
drive, so it doesn't matter if you reformat the hard drive, you're done. The firmware
itself can do a whole bunch of stuff.

So. Here are the names of the hard drive companies were it works: Western Digital,
Seagate, Maxtor and Samsung, and of course they support FAT, NTFS, EXT3 and
UFS. They probably now have support for additional file systems, but this is what we
can prove.

Please note at the bottom left and the bottom right: “Status: Released and Deployed.
Ready for Immediate Delivery”. And “Ujpiseesietie”. It's free.

No, you can’t get it. It’s not free as in free software. It’s free as in you're owned.
