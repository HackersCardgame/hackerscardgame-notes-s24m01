Text

Research has proven that exposure

To low frequency sound can cause

Very physiological effects

Many of them adverse one

Such as shivering, anxiety and breathlessness

They were born into the project

These showed extremely low frequency
Impact on human health has been raised
Electromagnetic waves can interfere
With brain activity

They're coming for you

They were born into the project

These showed extremely low frequency
Impact on human health has been raised
Electromagnetic waves can interfere
With brain activity

Subsonic sounds
