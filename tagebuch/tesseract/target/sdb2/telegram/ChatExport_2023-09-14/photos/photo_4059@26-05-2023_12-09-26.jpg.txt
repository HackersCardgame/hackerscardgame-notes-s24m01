allowed to have too many keyholders. They travel to the ceremony at their
own, or their employer's, expense.

‘What these men and women control is the system at the heart of the web:

the domain name system, or DNS. This isthe internet's version of

a telephone directory ~a series of registers linking web addresses to a series
of numbers, called IP addresses. Without these addresses, you would need to
know a long sequence of numbers for every site you wanted to visit. To get to
the Guardian, for instance, you'd have to enter "77.91.251.10" instead of
theguardian.com.

‘The master key is part of a new global effort to make the whole domain name
system secure and the internet safer: every time the keyholders meet, they
are verifying that each entry in these online “phone books” is authentic. This
prevents a proliferation of fake web addresses which could lead people to
malicious sites, used to hack computers or steal credit card details.

The east and west coast ceremonies each have seven keyholders, with a
further seven people around the world who could access a last-resort
‘measure to reconstruct the system if something calamitous were to happen.
