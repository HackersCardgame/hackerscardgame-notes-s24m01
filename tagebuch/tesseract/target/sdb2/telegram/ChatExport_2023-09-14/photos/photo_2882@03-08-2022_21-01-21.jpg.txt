“In many shamanic societies, if
you came to a medicine person
complaining of being

disheartened, dispirited, or

_ depressed, they would ask ~
_ one of four questions: When ~
did you stop dancing? When —

_ did you stop singing? When ~

3 E did you sop being enchanted 7
by stories? When did you ~
- stop finding comfort in az
_ sweet territory of silence?” =~
