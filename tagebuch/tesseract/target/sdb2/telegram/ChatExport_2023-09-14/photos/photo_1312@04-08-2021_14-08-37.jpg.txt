that combine 3D micro-printing and active matter have, thus far, focused on printing active

particles that are either larger than 10 microns or have relatively simple shapes.**-*® These
include 3D-printed microtorii,*° bullet-shaped particles?® and particles with serrated tails.
in addition to these studies, which use local fuel-based propulsion, other studies produced
nelical swimmers propelled by an external magnetic field.*”-*° The use of external fields is
however, not practical in many applications which require autonomous motion of the

particles themsel

rate the versatility of 3D microprinting to create
shapes, overcoming the current limitations in synthesizing
the disentanglement of the shape-contribution to active

jetry and shape couple to motility and motion patterns, is of

4ing synthetic and biological active systems alike, individually
