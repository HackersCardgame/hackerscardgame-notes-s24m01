Now... Put the phone down and try it now.

Remove the label of your perceived dis-ease, breathe deeply
and stowly into your body. Do this for 12 min. | have a free
guided version of this to stream link in bio if you'd like
guidance.

Then ask yourself... in this now moment... what is the core
problem? Is there one? Or is there just an energetic texture in
your body that you perceive is bothering you?

And even if there is a physical or life challenge that is real...
ask yourself... in this now moment as you breathe into your
body, do you feel you can find a way through it? One way or
another. Â©
