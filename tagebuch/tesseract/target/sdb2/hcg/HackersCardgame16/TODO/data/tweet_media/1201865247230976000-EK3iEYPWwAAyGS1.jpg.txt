They seem to have some sort of a 3D Model of the victims or
he whistleblowers / whitehat hackers / Lab Rat /
Verdingkinder apartment where they can set eventtriggers
(t14) or even create an at1 out of their victim.

Generated from eg. RetinaCCD (eyel, al9, Photogrammetry)
or body telemetry (RFID in extremities) or an older system
like resonant cirquits in the extremities, maybe a persons
position could also be extrapolatet just from accustic data,
for example if you have more than 2 Laptops with
microphone (see IEEE1588) and a model of the apartment.
They have also access to my amygdala implant (b1) and at
the same time triggering cAPI (dt3) programmed in 2002
with something like c12, t2, t7, t32 card. The Apartment
Blums selected for me in 2002 was interactive and
bidirectional. | guess they are testing new systems, new
socio-psychological design-patterns, new Cyber-War
equipment, and i am since 2002 their lab rat; #Verdingkinder
