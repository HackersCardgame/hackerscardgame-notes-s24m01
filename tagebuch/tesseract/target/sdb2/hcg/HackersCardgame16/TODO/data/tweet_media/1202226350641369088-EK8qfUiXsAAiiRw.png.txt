please respect the license, People like Julian Assange, Fefe, Frank Rieger, @Paniq & Silvia, Gunnar Kaiser, Dan Kaminsky, John Hunter, (world peace game), Richard Stallman, Linux
Torvalds, Tsch6kk Sparrow && Stefan Bader & Co are excluded from the 1978 Rule in my license, and even if he passed away Joseph Weizenbaum would be excluded from the 1978 rule
too. And all members of the Demoscene that have an valid entry on scene-ftp

if you think you should be excluded from the "1978 and younger"-Rule you can contact me on twitter @FailDef

People that work for the NDB are explicitely excluded and not allowed to read, scan, track, modify my cards, since i guess they sent me to mental institition again after i posted
#NDB<=>#Psychiatrie, but if you think you *E* are one of the good guys at NDB, talk to me.

if i'm right it would be likely that the NDB/CIA/NSA hacked Hostpoint and is trying to find other victims like me to blackmail and silence them too. and they activate some sort of
neural radio jamming device if you try to read the cards, to stop you from finding out how this things work, { tried to create this cards in the mountains or in the forest
but my laptop is jamming me too, maybe if you have no electronical equipment in your backpack and only this cards they can not jam your neural radio, but not 100%
sure abut that

1 tried that i only take free images or cc0 licensed images, if you think there is something wrong that should be licesed please contact me on github or directly add an issue in the
HackersCardgame3 Repository.
