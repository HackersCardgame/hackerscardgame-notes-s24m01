Is BGP safe yet? No.

Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the postal service of the Internet. It’s
responsible for looking at all of the available paths that data could travel and
picking the best route.

Unfortunately, it isn’t secure, and there have been some major Internet
disruptions as a result. But fortunately there is a way to make it secure.

ISPs and other major Internet players (Comcast, Sprint, Verizon, and others)
would need to implement a certification system, called RPKI.

Your ISP (Liberty Global, AS6830) does not implement BGP safely.
It should be using RPKI to protect the Internet from BGP hijacks.
