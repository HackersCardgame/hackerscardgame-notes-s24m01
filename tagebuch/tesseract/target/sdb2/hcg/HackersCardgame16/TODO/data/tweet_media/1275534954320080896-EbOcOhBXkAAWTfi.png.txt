So there is a planetary strategic surveillance system, and there - well, there are many of them
actually. Everything from | think off-planetary surveillance gear, which is probably the National
Reconnaissance Office and their satellite systems for surveillance like the Keyhole satellites - these
are all things most, for the most part we actually know about these things. They're on Wikipedia
But | want to talk a little bit more about the internet side of things because I think that's really
fascinating,

So part of what we are releasing today with Der Spiegel or what has actually been released - just to
be clear on the timeline, I'm not disclosing it first, 'm working as an independent journalist
summarizing the work that we have already released onto the internet as part of a publication
house that went through a very large editorial process in which we redacted all the names of
agents and information about those names, including their phone numbers and e-mail addresses.

applause]

And I should say that | actually think that the laws here are wrong, because they are in favor of an
oppressor who is criminal. So when we redact the names of people who are engaged in criminal
activity including drone murder, we are actually not doing the right thing,

r and I think that’s very important.

[applause]

We also redacted the names of victims of NSA surveillance, because we think that there's a
balance. Unfortunately there is a serious problem which is that the U.S. government asserts that
you don’t have standing to prove that you've been surveilled unless we release that kind of
information, but we don’t want to release that kind of information in case it could be a legitimate
target, and we - I'm really uncomfortable with that term, but let’s say that there is a legitimate
target, the most legitimate target, and we didn’t want to make that decision. But we did also want
to make sure that we didn’t harm someone, but we also wanted to show concrete examples. So if
you look at the Spiegel stuff on line, we redacted the names even of those who were victimized by
the NSA’s oppressive tactics, which I think actually goes further than is necessary, but | believe
that it strikes the right balance to ensure continued publication and also to make sure that people
are not harmed and that legitimate good things, however rare they may be, they are also not
harmed. So if you've been targeted by the NSA and you would have found out today if we had
taken a different decision, I'm really sorry, but this is the thing | think that keeps us alive, so this is,
the choice that | think is the right choice, and | think it’s also the safest choice for everyone.

So that said. basically the NSA has a aiant draanet surveillance svstem that thev call TURMOIL
