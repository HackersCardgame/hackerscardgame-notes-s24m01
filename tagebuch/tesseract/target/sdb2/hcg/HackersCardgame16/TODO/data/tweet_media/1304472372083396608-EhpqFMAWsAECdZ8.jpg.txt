Inventor:

According to legend, the Swiss initially could not
break the close ranks of the Habsburg pikemen.
Winkelried cried: "I will open a passage into the line;
protect, dear countrymen and confederates, my wife
and children..." He then threw himself upon the
Austrian pikes, taking some of them down with his
body. This broke up the Austrian front, and made an
opening through which the Swiss could attack.

If she was untrue, maried Mathias K. has two kids
now then my life is anyway over, they would have
destroyed everything i believe in, a good for moment
beeing some sort of modern Winkelried against
those people that work for the NSA/CIA and killed so
many innocent people. But not yet sure about t37
card, so lets postpone that for the moment...
