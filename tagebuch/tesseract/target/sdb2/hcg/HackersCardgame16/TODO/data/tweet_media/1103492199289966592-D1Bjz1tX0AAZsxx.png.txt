There are no aultiple personalities disorder, that 1s due toa single case 4n the story and because the person who wrote t down Just wanted to get fanous with this story and everything has been,
published unchecked

5 Although I did not read the book [0] that processed the story, the abstract ... is quite informative. In summary, her nother was schizophrenic, then and now nobody wants to be diagnosed with
Schizophrenia, 0 you say that you have "multiple personality” to avoid being pushed into the role of the schizophrenic mass murderer. The least known is that 90 of schzophrenics. are non-violent and
only 16% are violent: Breivik who murdered 77 innocent people. But also TV series such. “Criminal Minds" where in every third episode the mass murderer is a schizophrenic contributes to the image of

the assassinating schizophrenic, even if statistically 906 of then are wrong. I am ayself affected by schizophrenia and know myself therefore relatively well.

ut what exists is Dissociative Personality Disorder, where people fall into a kind of rigidity due to traumatic events such as rape, such as the Oppossun’s in Ice Age, and e.g. have to be brought
back with asnonjack or snetling salt, Since I know personally victins who show this behavior
What you are now saying is that there is a large conspirancy and that its maybe part of CIA project MKULTRA in the 1950s really tried to put people into a dissociative state so that they could then
Politically motivated murders (1,2), which did not work but still produced sany victins. Mostly people who were in psychiatry and thus had no legal rights or at least less rights than ordinary
citizens but also people who are’e.g. thus threatened illegal things of the state (USA) to leaks [3]. And that is such a classic conspiracy theory that most people once sit up until they have read the
appropriate Literature.

what does this have to do with the Pizzagate?

Well, actually quite a lot, as a schizophrenia patient, one is much more sensitive and breaks even on snall things even just a wrong word, or ignorance by a person close to hin. Often the
Schizophrenia patients also feel threatened in their sexual integrity because the smallest (eg a primitive pervert joke about sex) sustains it for days in the mind (in ny opinion, a. schizophrenic
hears not just voices but echoes of past events) him followed to the dreams. If that cones from a equal aged that is perhaps all right, but it comes from someone who is much older, for the patient
this statenent of the elderly person (eg the perverse joke) to the delusion, then the "virtual" sexual harassnent History and then rape (subjectively perceived, because in reality it was just a
perverted and inappropriate Joke) but for the schizophrenia patient, it becones a perceived reality. What you should not accuse the schizophrenia patient, because he can not help that he 1s suffering
‘from schizophrenia’ (dopamine excess in the brain)

Sand so then from an inappropriate joke, a "rape", at least if the Schzophrenia patient / patient 1:1 believes what he / she says. Without that he / she really had planned to p\
circulation, but for him / her still perceived Realtiat

2 wrong story into

hat I am clearly exempting fron this statesent are real rapes, but it is clear to everyone that when he is talking to a person who was really raped he has to answer carefully because he does not want
to tell a rape victim that he / she is lying, It is clear to everyone that this would cause even more harm in the victim's psyche, But soit is very difficult to distinguish between real rape and
conceited rape. I think there 99% of the interlocutors instinctively tines the victin / “victin" agree, because the few do not want to get involved in the role of the evil of the rape victins

believe .
