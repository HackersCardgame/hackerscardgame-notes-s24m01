Yo Richie Steez,

If a beautiful (and I mean BEAUTIFUL) woman and/or bird came up to you
and asked if you wanted to "Netflix and Chill", meaning watch TV shows
on the video streaming service Netflix and then probably have sex later,
would you do it? Do your principles of free software extend to sexual
relations?

Thanks,
Vincent Canfield
