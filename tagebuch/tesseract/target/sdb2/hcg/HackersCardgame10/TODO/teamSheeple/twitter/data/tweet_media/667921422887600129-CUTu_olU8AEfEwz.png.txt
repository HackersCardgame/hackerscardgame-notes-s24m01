NSA / CIA? [edit]

with gl_spy that runs in background and can be questioned over IRC “occasionally”, this
would be the perfect point to gather data about 1337 traders, but more important to gather
data about people that are able to break codes, cracking etc... of course the software bugs
that are fixed just obfuscates the hardware backdoors (eg. AX.25) since IBM gave the
unprofitable operating system business to Microsoft

CIA please delete to ack... 91.138.20.50 (talk) 04:17, 21 November 2015 (UTC) Landev
