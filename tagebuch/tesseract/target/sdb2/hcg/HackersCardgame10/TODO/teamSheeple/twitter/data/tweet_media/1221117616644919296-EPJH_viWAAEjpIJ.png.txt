What are good explanations for relay flags?

We received an Atlas patch that adds tooltips to relay flags, so that relay operators can better
understand what these flags mean. The patch author used dlr-spec.txt as their guide. | wonder if these
are good explanations, or if they should be closer to the spec or even implementation, or if they should
be more general. Here are the suggestions:

BadExit: This relay breaks stuff, either maliciously or through misconfiguration.

Fast: This relay has lots of bandwidth available.

HSDir: This relay is a v2 hidden service directory.
Named: This relay has a nickname.

Running: This relay has been online within the past 45 minutes.
Stable: This relay is considered stable,

V2Dir: This relay supports the v2 directory protocol.

Valid: This relay is running a version of Tor not known to be broken, and the directory authority has
not blacklisted it as suspicious.

Unnamed: This relay's configured nickname is used by another relay.

Exit: This relay is configured to be the last hop (exit relay) in a Tor circuit.

Are there better phrasings for some/all of these?
