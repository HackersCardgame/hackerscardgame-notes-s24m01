ith-a-synthetic-sensor
This Sensor can detect light, Infrared,
Electromagnetism (x,y,z), Temperature, Sound...
and it has synthetic sensor (calculated dy[n]/dt)
those things will then matched to a matrix of learned
events. So it can detect for example that you
enabled the microwave oven (Electromagnetism &&
Sound of the fan that cools down the Magnetron).
unfortunately Satan can also detect if a inncoent girl
uses her private epilator. If it is enabled and disabled
over a period more than 10 minutes. Most likely they
then add pedophile old people to her / his stream
and sell the her or both non-consensually as bitches.
