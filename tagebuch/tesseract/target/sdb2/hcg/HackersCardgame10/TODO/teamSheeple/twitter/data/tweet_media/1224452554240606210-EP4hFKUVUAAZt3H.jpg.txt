Inventor: Satan Year: ~2????

Patients that takes their drugs tend to be
remote controlled. The algorithm that
controles them seems to learn and adapt the
places where i try to hide so that i can work
without beeing bugged.

In K6nigsfelden they always know where the
patients are, otherwise they could not bug me
permanently. Maybe eyel card, or maybe
something like implanted RFID and eg. the
fire alarm system. Unfortunately tempering
with the fire alarm system would be a really
really bad idea, but maybe we could order the
same system as they have here in KÃ©nigsfelden
to temper with... worst case it's not a
default system and has unknown addons, in
that case i guess in the Workshop near the
railways they maybe have some unused...
