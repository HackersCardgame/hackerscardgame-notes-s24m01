4. First of all, this whole article is stupid. If the NSA put in a "permanent" backdoor then they would
be exposing the exact same backdoor to the Chinese, Russians, Iranians, North Koreans, Al
Queda, etc. etc, Newsflash: The NSA uses all these chips too and they don’t want to give up a
"secret" backdoor to their own enemies. There's no such thing as magic despite what the author
of the article believes

2, Second of al: As you said RMI chips could be compromised if we believe this magic fairy tale
Considering that ll chins are heavily used in smartphones/routers/other communication
devices, it would actually make *more* sense to put backdoors in those chips instead of x86 parts
that are often used in many applications where the NSA wouldn't be that interested (e.g. NSA don't
care about spying on your video game files...). 'm *not* saying that ARM chips have backdoors,
I'm just pointing it out.
