As soon as some institution like a curt ruled against
a person, a person that is maybe more victim than
offender, a lot of people tend to enjoy to punish or
even kill such an "offender".

| said the truth that i was using illegal drugs. The
judges maybe took to, but they did not yet confess
and use the one that confessed as Scapegoat to
cover up their own criminal activities.

In Swiss Media you hear sometimes about Cocaine
Abuse in Military. To confess would maybe help the
others to confess too, maybe. But first all those who
are guilty too will attack the one that confesses.
