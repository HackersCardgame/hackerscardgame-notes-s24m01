With enough computational Power you could create
avatars (Speech Synthesis / deep fakes) that are
"touring complete". | use this word for an avatar
that can do everything the real person could also
do. And with sociology design patterns and multiple
touring complete Avatars you even could simulate
complete real-live situations.

So you can never be sure if the person you hear on
eg Stimoceiver or US4877027 is really the person or
this group you are thinking you talking with. So best
thing is to meet face to face (then they abuse this
technology too) but if you know this person well you
would possibly find out.
