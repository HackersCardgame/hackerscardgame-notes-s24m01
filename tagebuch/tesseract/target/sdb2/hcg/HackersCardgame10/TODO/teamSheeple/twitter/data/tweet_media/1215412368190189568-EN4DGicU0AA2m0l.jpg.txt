If a whitehat hacker discvers that the company he
works in (for example in switzerland) is maybe
owned by nsa/cia and would begin to tweet about
that one would maybe ask, why the whistleblower
was killed after tweeting that. So those people would
attack him with different methods, eg. with declaring
him Schizophrenic or with things like induced
Occupational burnout. The chief maybe says stupid
things like, â€œwe only want to help marc" lets put him
in mental institution that he gets better. but as we
know already, a mental institution makes it much
much more worse.
To prevent that the remove whitehat hackers and
whistleblowers or even kill them tell the people
about this sort of nsa / cia infiltration and terrorism.
