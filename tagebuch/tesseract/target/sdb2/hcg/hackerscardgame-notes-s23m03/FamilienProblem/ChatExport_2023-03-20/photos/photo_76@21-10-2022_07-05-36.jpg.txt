Abstract

;Brainjacking' refers to the exercise of unauthorized control of another's electronic brain implant.
Whilst the possibilty of hacking a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has already been proven in both
‘experimental and real-life settings, there is reason to believe that it will soon be possible to interfere
with the software settings of the Implanted Pulse Generators (IPGs) that play a central role in Deep
Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems. Whilst brainjacking raises ethical concerns pertaining to privacy and
physical or psychological harm, we claim thatthe possibility of brainjacking DBS raises particularly
profound concerns about individual autonomy, since the possibilty of hacking such devices raises the
prospect of third parties exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning the subjec's
cognitive, emotional and motivational states. However, although it seems natural to assume that
brainjacking represents @ profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest thatthe implications of
brainjacking for individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by
brainjacking often serve to enhance certain aspects of the user's autonomy. The difficulty of
ascertaining the implications of brainjacking DBS for individual autonomy is exacerbated by the varied
Lundetstandings of autonomy in the neuroethical and philosophical literature. In this paper, we seek to
