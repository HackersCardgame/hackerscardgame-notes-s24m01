Delgado, “Radio Stimulation of different points in the amygdala and hippocampus in the four
patients produced a variety of effects, including pleasant sensations, elation, deep, thoughtful
concentration, odd feelings, super relaxation, colored visions, and other responses.” Rodriguez
Delgado stated that “brain transmitters can remain in a person's head for life. The energy to activate
the brain transmitter is transmitted by way of radio frequencies” [6]

Using the stimoceiver, Rodriguez Delgado found that he could not only elicit emotions, but he could
also elicit specific physical reactions. These specific physical reactions, such as the movement of a
limb or the clenching of a fist, were achieved when Rodriguez Delgado stimulated the motor cortex. A
human whose implants were stimulated to produce a reaction were unable to resist the reaction and

t said “I guess, doctor, that your electricity is stronger than my will”. Some consider on

of Rodriguez Delgado's most promising finds is that of an area called the septum within the limbic
region. This area, when stimulated by Rodriguez Delgado, produced feelings of strong euphoria.
These euphoric feelings were sometimes strong enough to overcome physical pain and depression.(2]

Rodriguez Delgado created many inventions and was called a “technological wizard” by one of his
Yale colleagues. Other than the stimoceiver, Rodriguez Delgado also created a “SIRS

Rodriguez Delgado also invented an early version of what is now a cardiac pacemaker [2]

fin Rhode Island, Rodriguez Delgado did some work at what is now a closed mental hos

patients who were “desperately ill patients whose disorders had resisted all previous treatments”and
fimplanted electrodes in about 25 of them. Most of these
epileptics. To determine the best placement of electrodes within the human patients, Delgado initially
looked to the work of Wilder Penfield, who studied epileptics' brains in the 1930s, as well as earlier
animal experiments, and studies of brain-damaged people.[2]

‘The most famous example of the stimoceiver in action occurred at a Cérdoba bull breeding ranch,
Rodriguez Delgado stepped into the ring with a bull which had had a stimoceiver implanted within its
brain. The bull charged Delgado, who pressed a remote control button which caused the bull to stop
its charge. Always one for theatrics, he taped this stunt and it can be seen today.{7] The region of the
brain Rodriguez Delgado stimulated when he pressed the hand-held transmitter was the caudate
