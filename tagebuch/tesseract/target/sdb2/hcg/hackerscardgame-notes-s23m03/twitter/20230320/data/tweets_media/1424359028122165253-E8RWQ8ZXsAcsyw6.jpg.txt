Here's another one.

This one’s called SWAP. In this case it replaces the Host Protected Area of the hard drive, and you can see
alittle graph where the target systems, see the internet, Interactive OPS, so they've got like a guy who is
hacking you in real time, the People’s Liberation Army, uh, NSA, and —

[laughter]

And you can see all of these different things about it. Each one of these things, including SNEAKERNET,
these are different programs, most of which we revealed today in Der Spiegel. But you'll notice that it's
Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Slang.

How many Al Qaeda people use Sélafié, do you suppose?

This tells you a really important point. They are interested in compromising the infrastructure of systems, not
just individual people. They want to take control and literally colonize those systems with these implants. And
that’s not part of the discussion. People are not talking about that because they don't know about that yet.
But they should, Because in addition to the fact that Sun is a U.S. company which they are building
capabilities against — that to me, really, it really bothers me; | can't tell you how much that bothers me — we
also see that they're attacking Microsoft, another U.S. company, and Linux and FreeBSD, where there are a
lot of people that are building it from all around the world. So they're attacking not only collective efforts and
corporate effort, but basically every option you can possibly can, from end users down to telecom core
things.
