"Brainjacking’ refers to the exercise of unauthorized control of another's electronic brain References

proven in both experimental and real-life settings, there is reason to believe that it will soon be Author information
possible to interfere with the software settings of the Implanted Pulse Generators (IPGs) that Rights and permissions
play a central role in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems. Whilst brainjacking raises ethical About this atcle

concerns pertaining to privacy and physical or psychological harm, we claim that the
possibility of brainjacking DBS raises particularly profound concerns about individual
autonomy, since the possiblity of hacking such devices raises the prospect of third parties
exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning the subject’s cognitive, emotional and
‘motivational states. However, although it seems natural to assume that brainjacking.
represents a profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest that the implications of
brainjacking for individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by
brainjacking often serve to enhance certain aspects ofthe user’s autonomy. The difficulty of
ascertaining the implications of brainjacking DBS for individual autonomy is exacerbated by
thev

ied understandings of autonomy in the neuroethical and philosophical literature. In
this paper, we seek to bring some conceptual clarity to this area by mapping out some of the

prominent views concerning the different dimension of autonomous agency, and the
