less) the case for other errors.

Although predictive processing provides a comfortable framework with which to account for our
results regarding STM, we recognize that there is already a vast literature about the theoretical
foundations of false memory in LTM. For example, one explanation for the occurrence of
llusions in LTM comes from’ [47]. [IU states that memory consists of two
parts, a verbatim part, representing the exact memory input, and a gist part, representing the
meaning of the input, based on a semantic analysis. Could [ail also explain the current
jindings in STM? It is possible that the verbatim representation of the visual input is the physical
pseudo-letter, and that the high-level gist that is stored is something like “letter” and “mirrored”.
With such a representation, it is possible that the “letter” gist is stronger than the “mirrored gist,
thus surviving longer. However, [sill] predicts that high similarity between a target and its
mirrored counterpart should inhibit false memories [48]. This is not consistent with the current
data: The mirrored counterpart (the real letter) and the target (the pseudo-letter) are extremely
similar, yet false memories are abundant. Therefore, it seems that [SIN cannot accurately
account for the occurrence of this type of memory illusions in STM. In contrast to [ZIl, which
