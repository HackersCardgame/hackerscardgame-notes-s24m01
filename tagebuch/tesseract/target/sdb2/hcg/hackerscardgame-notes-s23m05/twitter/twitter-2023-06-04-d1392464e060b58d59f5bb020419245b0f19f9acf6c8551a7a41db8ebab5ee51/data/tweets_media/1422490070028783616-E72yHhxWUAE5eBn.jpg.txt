possibility of brainjacking DBS raises particularly profound concerns about individual

autonomy, since the possiblity of hacking such devices raises the prospect of third parties

exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning the subject’s cognitive, emotional and

‘motivational states. However, although it seems natural to assume that brainjacking.

represents a profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest that the implications of

brainjacking for individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by

brainjacking often serve to enhance certain aspects of the user’s autonomy. The difficulty of

ascertaining the implications of brainjacking DBS for individual autonomy is exacerbated by

the varied understandings of autonomy in the neuroethical and philosophical literature. In

this paper, we seek to bring some conceptual clarity to this area by mapping out some of the
