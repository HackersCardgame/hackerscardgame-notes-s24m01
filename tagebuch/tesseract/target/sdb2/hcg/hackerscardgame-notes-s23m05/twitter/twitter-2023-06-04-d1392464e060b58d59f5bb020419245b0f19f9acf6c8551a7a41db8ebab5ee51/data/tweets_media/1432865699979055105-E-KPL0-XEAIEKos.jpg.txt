Three incredible free VSTs: Surge, Helm, and Synth

(Apologies if there's some wacky mobile formatting)

just saw a post that mentioned how paid VSTS sometimes aren't worth it; after seeing it, figured I'd
make alist. These are my three favorite free VST synthesizers of all time:

1. Synth 1 - Best for analog emulations and warping back to the 80s

Possibly the most popular one on the list, Syntht is an exceptional analog emulation developed by
Ichiro Toda. While it does come equipped with some killer features, one of my favorite parts is the
absolutely KICK ASS interface. I's all pixelated and vintage looking and just fucking awesome,
honestly, The learning curve isnt too steep at al it seems a bit conventional at frst, but with the
FW/RM capabilities, ings, low CPU load, and easily the best unison I've ever heard, Syntht is a
must-have,

Wine4/Macosea:

2. Helm - Best for grity, grimy, gnarly, and wholeheartedly digital sound design

This was my first VST. It has been continually updated and changed over the course of many years, and
set to continue. It's also stunning. Developed by Matt Tytel, Helm has the best workflow on the lis.

Being able to make a lead that digs its way into your brain or a teeth smashing, eye crushing mid bass

within five minutes of opening a plugin is something truly unique and wonderful. Of course, Helm

can't pass for an analog synth, or anything close; it doesn't have the clean sine waves* or warm

(Moog owner moaning) that other VSTs do, but that's where its beauty lies. It's chock full of possibilty

without being overwhelming, and, ike Syntht, i's CPU friendly. To wrap it up, Helm is a digital monster
at rips cheeks,

‘It still has sine oscillators (as most VSTs do), the aliasing is just alittle coarse. They work great
