Controversy [edit]

The effects of this radio ff@quency on humans have been studied by the military for years, and much, but not all of the -
research has been published openly in peer-reviewed journals.!45)

Anews article criticized the sheer amount of time it is taking to field this system,
citing the potential it had to avert a great deal of pain and suffering in volatile
areas around the world. (461

While it is claimed not to cause burns under "ordinary use", [47II48] it is also
described as being similar to that of an incandescent light bulb being pressed
against the skin,'"4] which can cause severe burns in just a few seconds. The
beam can be focused up to 700 meters away, and is said to penetrate thick
clothing although not walls.!49] At 105 GHz} the frequency is much higher than the -
2.45 GHz of a microwave oven. This frequency was chosen because it penetrates less than 1/64 of an inch (0.4 mm),
which — in most humans, except for eyelids and the thinner skin of babies — avoids the second skin layer (the dermis)

where critical structures are found such as nerve endings and blood vessels.

Active Denial System Demo

The early methodology of testing, in which volunteers were asked to remove glasses, contact lenses and metallic objects —
that could cause hot spots, raised concerns as to whether the device would remain true to its purpose of non-lethal

temporary incapacitation if used in the field where safety precautions would not be taken. However, these tests were early

in the program and part of a thorough and methodical process to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the
