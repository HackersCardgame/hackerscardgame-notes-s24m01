In his book, Principles of Behavior,'â€œ] he developed the following formula:
sER=sHRxDxVxK

Where:

Ep is excitatory potential (likelihood that the organism would produce response r to stimulus s),

sHr is the habit strength (derived from previous conditioning trials),

Dis drive strength (determined by, e.g., the hours of of food, water, etc.),

V is stimulus intensity dynamism (some stimuli will have greater influences than others, such as the lighting of a situation),
and K is incentive (how appealing the result of the action is).!8I("5]

A variety of other factors were gradually added to the formula to account for results not included by this simple function. Eventually the formula became:
sER =VxXDXKxJxXsHR-IR-slR-sOR-sIR

such that Ip is reactive inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that dissipates over time),
sl is conditioned inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that does not dissipate over time).!'5] gLp is Reaction threshold, the
smallest amount of reinforcement that will produce learning.
