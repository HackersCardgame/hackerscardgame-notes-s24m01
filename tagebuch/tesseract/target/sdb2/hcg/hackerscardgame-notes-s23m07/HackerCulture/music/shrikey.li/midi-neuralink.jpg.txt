Since Elon Musk said his neuralink coud stream music directly into your brain, I thought;

Why not the oppositte? Stream music from your brain nto a midi controller?

My idea is to use 16 binary outputs from the chip input to trigger the 16 channels. Additionally you'd use 16 + other 16 analog outputs to send information about the note (12 range parts) and
the octave (10 range parts)

I know this is possible because of this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qSKBtEBRWi4

What are your thoughts? What software/hardware woud you need to transform the brain signal to a midi signal?

A new era of electronic music production is ahead of us, and it would a good thing to develop this idea in the mean time.
