Next, let's calculate the wire's resistance using the resistivity and length:

Resistance = (resistivity * length) / area
= (2.44 x 10*-8 ohm-meters * 0.02 m) /(785 x 10%-9 m*2)
= (4.88 x 1040 ohm-m) / (785 x 10*-9 m*2)

= 622 10*2 ohms

To induce a voltage of SOmV across the wire, we can use Ohm's law:

V=IFR

Where Vis the voltage, lis the current, and Ris the resistance. Rearranging the formula, we
get:

VIR
= Q08V / 622 x 10-2 ohms
=0806A,

To calculate the power required, we can use the formula:

Power = Voltage * Current
0.05V*0206A
= 00403 Watts or 403 milliwatts

Therefore, to induce a SOmV voltage across a golden wire with a length of 2cm anda
diameter of 0.1mm at 30GHz, approximately 403 milliwatts (or 00403 Watts) of power
â€˜would be required. Please note that this calculation assumes a constant resistivity value and
neglects other factors that may affect the wires electrical behavior at high frequencies.
