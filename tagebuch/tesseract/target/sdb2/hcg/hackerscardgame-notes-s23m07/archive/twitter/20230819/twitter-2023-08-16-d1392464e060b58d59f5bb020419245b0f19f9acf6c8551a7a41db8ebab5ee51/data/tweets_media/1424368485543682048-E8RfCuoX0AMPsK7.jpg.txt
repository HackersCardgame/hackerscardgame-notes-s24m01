So this is important, because members of the U.S. Congress, they have no clue about these things. Literally,
in the case of the technology. Ask a Congressman about TCP/IP, Forget it. You can't even get a meeting with
them. I've tried, Doesn't matter. Even if you know the secret interpretation of Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act
and you go to Washington, D.C. and you meet with their aides, they still won't talk to you about it. Part of that
is because they don't have a clue, and another part of it is because they can't talk about it because they
don't have a political solution. Absent a political solution, it's very difficult to get someone to admit that there
is a problem,

Well, there is a problem, so we're going to create a political problem and also talk about some of the
solutions.

The Cypherpunks generally have come up with some of the solutions when we talk about encrypting the
entire internet. That would end dragnet mass surveillance in a sense, but it will SOMGIBAGK in a different
sense even with encryption. We need both a marriage of a technical solution and we need a political solution
to go with it, and if we don't have those two things, we will unfortunately be stuck here.

But at the moment the NSA, basically, | feel, has more power than anyone in the entire world — any one
agency or any one person. So Emperor Alexander, the head of the NSA, really has a lot of power. If they
want to right now, they'll know that the IME! of this phone is interesting. It's very warm, which is another
funny thing, and they would be able to break into this phone almost certainly and then turn on the
microphone, and all without a court.

So that to me is really scary. And | especially dislike the fact that if you were to be building these types of
things, they treat you as an opponent if you wish to be able to fulfill the promises that you make to your
customers. And as someone who writes security software, | think that's bullshit.
