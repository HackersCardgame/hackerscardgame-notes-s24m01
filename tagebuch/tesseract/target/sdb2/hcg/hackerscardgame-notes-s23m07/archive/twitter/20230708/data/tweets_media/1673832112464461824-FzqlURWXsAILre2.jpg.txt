Eagle Vision 1 (Commercial Satellite Imagery)

Article Talk

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Eagle Vision One (EV1) was a military based Commercial Satellite Imagery (CS!) capability
programmed and funded by HQ AF/A2QS (Air Force ISR Innovations). It is located at Ramstein Air
Base, Germany, and is staffed by intelligence personnel assigned to the 24th Intelligence Squadron
(2418). The mission of EV1 is to maintain a deployable commercial satellite imagery system ready to
‘support contingency operations, theater security cooperation events, and disaster relief efforts. The
EV1 system consists of the two elements: a Data Acquisition Segment (DAS) which includes a direct,
downlink antenna and a computer server shelter that collects and processes imagery into a standard
format, and a transit-cased Data Integration Segment (DIS) that processes the standard format
products into useful products.

EV1 works with satelite vendors from France (Spot 6 & 7, Pléaiades 1A & 1B), Canada (RADARSAT
1&2), and India (CARTOSAT1 & 2) to provide unclassified imagery to customers.

EV is part of a larger Eagle Vision enterprise that consists of four other units stationed in South
Carolina, Alabama, California, and Hawaii

Newest tools at EV1: EVR2EST is an unclassified imagery server used to upload and share imagery
products. See the link below to view the EVR2EST server.
