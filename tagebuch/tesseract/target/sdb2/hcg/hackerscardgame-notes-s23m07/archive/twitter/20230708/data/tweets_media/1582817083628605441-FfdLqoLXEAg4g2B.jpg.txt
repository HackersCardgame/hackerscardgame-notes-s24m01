Abstract

‘atanjacking’ refers to the exercise of unauthorized control of anothers electronic brain implant.
Whilst the possibilty of hacking a Brain-Computer Interface (BC) has already been proven in both
‘experimental and real-life settings, there is reason to believe that it wll soon be possible to interfere
With the software settings ofthe Implanted Pulse Generators (PGs) that play a central role in Deep.
Brain Stimulation (085) systems. Whilst branjackng raises ethical concers pertaining to privacy and
physical or psychological harm, we claim that the possiblity of branjacking DBS raises particulary
profound concerns about individual autonomy, since the possibilty of hacking such devices raises the
‘prospect of third partes exerting influence over the neural circuits undespinning the subject's
cognitive, emotional and motivational states. However, although it seems natural to assume that
branjacking represents a profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest thatthe implications of
braijacking for individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by
braijacking often serve to enhance certain aspects ofthe users autonomy. The difclty of
ascertaining the implications of brainjacking D&S for individual autonomy is exacerbated by the varied
Understandings of autonomy inthe neuroethcal and philosophical Iterature. In this paper, we seek to
