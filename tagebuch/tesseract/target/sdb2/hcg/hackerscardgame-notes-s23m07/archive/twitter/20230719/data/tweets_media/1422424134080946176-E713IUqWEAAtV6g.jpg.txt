There was a talk at OHM this year [OHIM2013] where a guy talked about replacing
hard drive firmware. You were onto something. You were really onto something.
Whoever you are, you were onto something. Because the NSA has a program here,
IRATEMONK, and that’s exactly what they do. They replace the firmware in the hard

drive, so it doesn’t matter if you reformat the hard drive, you're done. The firmware
itself can do a whole bunch of stuff.

Seagate, Maxtor and SEiustiae), and of course they support FAT, NTFS, EXT3 and ‘-
UFS. They probably now have support for additional file systems, but this is what we

can prove.

No, you can't get it. It's not free as in free software. It’s free as in you're owned.
