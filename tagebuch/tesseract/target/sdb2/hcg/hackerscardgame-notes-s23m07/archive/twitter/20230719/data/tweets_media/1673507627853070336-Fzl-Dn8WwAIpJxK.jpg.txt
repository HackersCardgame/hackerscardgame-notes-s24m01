Behavior {ecit]

Clark Hull found inspiration for his own theory of learning after learning about Ivan Paviov's idea of conditional reflexes, and Watson’s system of
behaviorism "2! He also was impacted by Edward Thorndike, as he adapted his theory to include and agree with Thorndike's law of effect" After Hull
discovered his interest in learning theories from Pavlov, Watson, and Thorndike, he dedicated much of his own laboratory work to perfecting his own
theory. Also, many experiments concerning his learning theory came from Hull's students, who carried out many different experiments in Hull's lab after
finding inspiration from seminars and lectures in classes that Hull taught!”

‘Quantification was a chief concern of Hull's studies, and he continued to apply tis interest to behaviorism.l‘I°! while interested in the work of Watson, he
‘was not entirely convinced. After listening to lectures by gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka, he began to work towards a neobehaviorism.! His goal was to
determine the laws of behavior and how they can be used to determine future behaviors.°I®) His work with the computing machine led him to believe a
machine could be built to replicate mental processes!)

Inhiis book, Principles of Behavior"! he developed the following formula

sEn= stig D*V*K

Where:

Ea is excitatory potential (likelihood that the organism would produce response r to stimulus s),

Hp is the habit strength (derived from previous conditioning trials),

Dis drive strength (determined by, @.9., the hours of deprivation of food, water, etc),

Vis stimulus intensity dynamism (some stimuli will have greater influences than others, such as the lighting of a situation),

‘and K is incentive (how appealing the result ofthe action is) I*5}

‘A variety of other factors were gradually added to the formula to account for results not included by this simple function. Eventually the formula became:

sEa=VxDxKxJx sHe-Ie-sla- sOr-sle

lk is conditioned inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that does not dissipate over time)."5] sLp is Reaction threshold, the
‘smallest amount of reinforcement that will produce learning,

9 continual performance of a behavior that dissipates over time),

Hull originally intended to make a trilogy of books on behavior, explaining social and cognitive behavior! Instead, he focused on continuously revising his
original formula as exceptions showed up.'*!

Hull's emphasis was on experimentation, an organized theory of learning, and the nature of habits, which he argued were associations between a stimulus
and a response !®] Behaviors were influenced by goals that sought to satisfy primary drives—such as hunger, thirst, sex, and the avoidance of pain. His
