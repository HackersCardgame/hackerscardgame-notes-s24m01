Okay, so now we're going to get scary. So that's just the passive stuff. There exists another system that's called
TURBINE, and we revealed about this system in the Spiege/ publication today as well. So if TURMOIL is deep
packet inspection, then TURBINE is deep packet injection. And itis the system that combined together with the
things — with TURMOIL and TURBINE you can create a platform which they have consolidated which they call
QFIRE. QFIRE is essentially a way to programmatically look at things that flow across the internet that they see
with TURMOIL and then using TURBINE they're able to actually inject packets to try to do attacks, and I'll describe
some of those attacks in detail in a moment.

But essentially the interesting thing about QFIRE also is that they have a thing that's called a diode. So if you have
for example a large number of systems where you control them, you might say, “Hey, what are you doing on that
backbone?” “Hey, what's going on with these systems?” And they could say, well, you know, we paid for access,
we're doing this, its all legal, etcetera. QFIRE has this really neat little detail which is that they compromise other
people's routers and then redirect through them so that they can beat the SSSRaIei.

‘And how they do that is that they have a passive sensor that's nearby a thing that they can inject from, and when
they see that thing sees a selector that is interesting to them or is doing a thing that they would like to tamper with
in some way, then they take a packet, they encapsulate the packet, they send it to the diode, which might be your
home router potentially, and then that home router decapsulates that packet and sends it out. And because that is
very close to you, and let's say you're visiting Yahoo, then the Yahoo packet will not beat you. That is, they will not
beat the NSA or GCHQ. So it's a race condition. And so they basically are able to control this whole system and
then localize attacks in that process.

So that's a pretty — pretty scary stuff, actually. And while itis a digital thing, | think it's important to understand that
this is what Jefferson talked about when he talked about tyranny. This is turkey tyranny, and it's not that it's
coming, i's actually here. It's just merely a question about whether or not they'll use it in a way that we think is a
good way or not a good way.

One of the scariest parts about this is that for this system or these sets of systems to exist, we have been kept
