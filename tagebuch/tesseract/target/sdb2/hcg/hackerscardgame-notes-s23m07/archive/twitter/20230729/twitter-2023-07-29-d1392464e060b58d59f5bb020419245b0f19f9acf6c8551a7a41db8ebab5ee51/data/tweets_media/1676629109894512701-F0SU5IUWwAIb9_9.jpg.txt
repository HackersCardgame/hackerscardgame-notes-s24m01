I'm afraid some Telegram users found your messages annoying and
forwarded them to our team of moderators for inspection. The
moderators have confirmed the report and your account is now
limited until 7 Jul 2023, 22:55 UTC.

While the account is limited, you will not be able to do certain things
‘on Telegram, like writing to strangers who haven't contacted you
first or adding them to groups and channels.

Your account will be automatically released on 7 Jul 2023, 22:55 UTC.
Please note that if you repeat what got you limited and users report
you again, the limitations will ast longer next time. Subscribers of
Telegram Premium have reduced times for initial imitations. jg.05
