Abstract

"Brainjackng' refers to the exercise of unauthorized control of another's electronic brain implant.
Whilst the possibilty of hacking a Brain-Computer Interface (BC!) has already been proven in both
‘experimental and real-life settings, there ie reason to believe that wll soon be posible to interfere
with the software settings ofthe Implanted Pulse Generators (PGs) that play a central oe in Deep
Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems. Whilst brainjacking raises ethical concerns pertaining to privacy and
‘physical or psychological harm, we claim thatthe possibilty of brainjacking DBS raises particularly
profound concerns about individual autonomy, since the possibilty of hacking such devices raises the
prospect of third partis exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning the subject's
cognitive, emotional and mativaional states, However, althoughit seems natural to assume that
brainjacking represents a profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest that the implications of
brainjacking for individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by
brainjacking often serve to enhance certain aspects ofthe user's autonomy. The difficulty of
ascertaining the implications of brainjacking DBS for individual autonomy is exacerbated by the varied
‘understandings of autonomy in the neuroethical and philosophical literature. in this paper, we seek to:
