‘out many different experiments in Hull's lab after finding inspiration from seminars and lectures in classes that Hull taught.(7)

Quantification was a chief concern of Hull's studies, and he continued to apply this interest to behaviorism.Il41l8 while interested in the
work of Watson, he was not entirely convinced. After listening to lectures by gestalt psychologist Kurt Koffka, he began to work towards a
neobehaviorism.!°) His goal was to determine the laws of behavior and how they can be used to determine future behaviors.'II5] His work
with the computing machine led him to believe a machine could be built to replicate mental processes.!®l
In his book, Principles of Behavior,!"4] he developed the following formula:

WSER=sHa*xD*xVxK
Where:

‘gERis excitatory potential (likelihood that the organism would produce response r to stimulus s),

‘gHis the habit strength (derived from previous conditioning trials),

"Dis drive strength (determined by, e.g., the hours of deprivation of food, water, etc.),

‘Wis stimulus intensity dynamism (some stimuli will have greater influences than others, such as the lighting of a situation),
and Kis incentive (how appealing the result of the action is).{81I"5)

Avariety of other factors were gradually added to the formula to account for results not included by this simple function. Eventually the
formula became:

R= VX D x KRUREHR - Ip slg sOr- slr

such that Ip is reactive inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that dissipates over time),

sla is conditioned inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that does not dissipate over time).!15] sLp is Reaction
threshold, the smallest amount of reinforcement that will produce learning.

Hull originally intended to make a trilogy of books on behavior, explaining social and cognitive behavior.'5 Instead, he focused on
