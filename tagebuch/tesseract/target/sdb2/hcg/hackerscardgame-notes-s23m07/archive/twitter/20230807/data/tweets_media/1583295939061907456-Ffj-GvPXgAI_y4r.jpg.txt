Abstract

‘atanjackng’ refers to the exercise of unauthorized control of anothers electronic bran implant.
Whilst the possibilty of hacking a Bran-Computer Interface (Bi) has already been proven in both
‘experimental and real-life settings, there is reason to believe that it wll soon be possible to interfere
With the software settings ofthe implanted Pulse Generators (\PGs) that play a central role in Deep
Brain Stimulation (085) systems. Whilst branjacking raises ethical concers pertaining to privacy and
physical or psychological harm, we claim that the possiblity of branjacking DBS raises particulary
profound concerns about individual autonomy, since the possibilty of hacking such devices raises the
prospect of third partes exerting influence over the neural circuits undespioning the subject's
cognitive, emotional and motivational states. However, although it seems natural to assume that
branjacking represents a profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest thatthe implications of
braijacking for individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by
biraijacking often serve to enhance certain aspect ofthe users autonomy. The difculty of
ascertaining the implications of brainjacking D&S for individual autonomy is exacerbated by the varied
understandings of autonomy inthe neuroethcal nd philosophical iterature. In this paper, we seek to
