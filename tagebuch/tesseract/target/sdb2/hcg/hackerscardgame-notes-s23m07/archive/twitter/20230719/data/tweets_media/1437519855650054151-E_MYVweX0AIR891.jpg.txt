Aarau seems to have a gun-shot noise detection
that has multiple functions and seems to be widely
abused against me -> KAPO AARGAU? <- FEDPOL

1. Detect gun-shots

2. With forced neurosis "smoke now” they send
victims outside to smoke and then activates the
inducet cough function to locate the victims for
hunting them down or add proteine calculators to
them (disabled 2001, $herFather is a bad police
officer that is already a murderer, obligatorisches
schiessen?)

3, to enter permanent records into the mainframe to
the 3D Model of victims
