‘And how they do thats that they have a passive sensor that's nearby a thing that they can inject from, and when
they see that thing sees a selector that is interesting to them or is doing a thing that they would lke to tamper
within some way, then they take a packet, they encapsulate the packet, they send itto the dlode, which might be
your home router potentially, and then that home router decapsulates that packet and sends it out. And because
{hat is very close to you, and let's say you'e visting Yahoo, then the Yanoo packet wil not beat you. That is,

they will not beat the NSA or GCHA. So its a race condition, And so they basically re able to control ths whole
‘system and then localize attacks in that process.

‘So thats a pretty — pretty scary stuf, actually. And while its a digital thing, | think its important to understand
{at this is what Jefferson taked about when ne talked about tyranny. This is tumkey tyranny, and it's not that it's
‘coming, its actually here. Its just merely a question about whether or not they'l use tina way that we think is a
{good way or not a good way.

‘One of the scariest parts about this is that for ths system or these sets of systems to exist, we have been kept
vuinerabie. So itis the case that ifthe Chinese, ifthe Russians, f people here wish to build ths system, there's
‘nothing that stops them. And in fact the NSA has ina eral sense retarded the process by which we would
secure the internet because it establishes a hegemony of power, their power in secret to do these things. And in
fact Ive seen evidence that shows that there are so many compromises taking place between the diferent Five
yes signals inteligence groups that they actually have ists that explain, Ifyou see this back door on the
system, contact a friendly agency. You've just recompromised the machine of another person.

‘Sovnen we tak about his, we have to consider that hs is designed for a-scale explotation, And as far as can
telits being used for a-scaleexploation. Which snot realy in my mind a targeted partcularzed type of thing
but rather i's ISI operations. i's SIS expeations. i's more ike NN crusades, i you wi. And in some
cases, looking atthe evidence, that seems to be what ts. Targeting Musims, | might ad, because that's what
they're interested in doing.

‘So that said, that's the intemet, and we get al the way down tothe bottom and we get to the Close Access
(Operations and Oft-Net. Off-Net and Close Access Operations are pretty scary things, but basicaly ths is what
we would calla back bag job. That's where these guys, they break into your house, they put something in your
‘computer and they take other things out of your computer.

Here's an example. First top secret document ofthe talk so far.
