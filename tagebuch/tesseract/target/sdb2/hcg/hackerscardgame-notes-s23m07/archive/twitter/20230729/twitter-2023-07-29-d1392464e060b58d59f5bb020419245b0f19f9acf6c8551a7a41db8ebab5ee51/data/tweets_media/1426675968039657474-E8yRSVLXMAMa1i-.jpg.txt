Evolutionary algorithm

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

In computational inteligence (Ci), an evolutionary algorithm (EA) is a subset of evolutionary computation!" generic population-based metaheuristic
‘optimization algorithm. An EA uses mechanisms inspired by biological evolution, such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, and selection, Cancidate solutions
to the optimization problem play the ole of individuals in a population, and the fitness function determines the quality of the solutions (see also loss function).
Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators.

Evolutionary algorithms often perform well approximating solutions to all types of problems because they ideally do not make any assumption about the underlying
fitness landscape. Techniques from evolutionary algorithms applied to the modeling of biological evolution are generally limited to explorations of microevolutionary
processes and planning models based upon cellular processes. In most real applications of EAs, computational complexity Isa prohibiting factor! Infact, this
‘computational complexity is due to fitness function evaluation. Fitness approximation Is one of the solutions to overcome this dificlty. However, seemingly simple
EA can solve often complex probiems:!*3#2" "1 therefore, there may be no direct link between algorithm complexity and problem complexty.
