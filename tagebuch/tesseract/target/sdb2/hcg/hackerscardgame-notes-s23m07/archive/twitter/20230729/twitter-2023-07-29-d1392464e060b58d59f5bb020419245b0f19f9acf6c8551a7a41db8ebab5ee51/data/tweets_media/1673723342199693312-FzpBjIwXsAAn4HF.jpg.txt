they — you like that, by the way? So, you know, that's an extremist site. So (coughs) you might have heard about
that. A lot of Republicans in the United States read it. So — Right before they wage illegal imperialist wars.

So the point is that you go to a FOXACID server and it basically does a survey of your box and decides if it can
break into it or not, and then it does.

Yep, that's basically it,

And the FOXACID URLs, a few of them are public. Some of the details about that have been made public, about
how the structure of the URLs are laid out and so on. An important detail is that they pretend that they're Apache,
but they actually do a really bad job. So they're like Hacking Team, maybe it's the same guys, | doubt it though, the
NSA wouldn't slum with scumbags like that, but. Basically you can tell, you can find them, because they aren't
really Apache servers. They pretend to be something else.

The other thing is that none of their infrastructure is in the United States. So, real quick anonymity question. You
have a set of things and you know that a particular attacker from one place. Every country on the
planet potentially, but never one place. The one place where most of the internet is. What does that tell you in
terms of anonymity? It tells you usually that they're hiding something about that one place. Maybe there's a legal
requirement for this. Is not clear to me. But what is totally clear to me is that if you see this type of infrastructure
and itis not in the United States, there is a chance, especially today, that it's the NSA’s Tailored Access and
Operations division.

‘And here’s an important point. When the NSA can't do it, they bring in GCHQ.
