And you can see all of these different things about it. Each one of these
things, including SNEAKERNET, these are different programs, most of
which we revealed today in Der Spiegel. But you'll notice that it’s
Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.

How many Al Qaeda people use Solaris, do you suppose?

This tells you a really important point. They are interested in
compromising the infrastructure of B¥Se@ucs, not just individual people.
They want to take control and literally colonize those with these
implants. And that’s not part of the discussion. People are not talking
about that because they don’t know about that yet. But they should.
Because in addition to the fact that Sun is a U.S. company which they are
building capabilities against — that to me, really, it really bothers me; |
can’t tell you how much that bothers me — we also see that they’re
attacking Microsoft, another U.S. company, and Linux and FreeBSD,
where there are a lot of people that are building it from all around the
world. So they’re attacking not only collective efforts and corporate effort,

but basically every option you can possibly can, from end users down to
telecom core things.
