The Hippocratic Oath

1 swear by Apollo Healer, by Asclepius, by Hygieia, by Panacea, and by all the gods
and goddesses, making them my witnesses, that | will carry out, according to my
‘ability and judgment, this oath and this indenture.

To hold my teacher in this art equal to my own parents; to make him partner in my
livelihood; when he is in need of money to share mine with him; to consider his
family as my own brothers, and to teach them this art, if they want to learn it,

without fee or indenture; to impart precept, oral instruction, and all other
instruction to my own sons, the sons of my teacher, and to indentured
pupils who have taken the Healer’s oath, but to nobody else.
