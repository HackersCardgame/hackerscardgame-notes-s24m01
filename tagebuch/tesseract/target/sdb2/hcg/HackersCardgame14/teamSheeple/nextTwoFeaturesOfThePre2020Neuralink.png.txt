Next Feature unlocked on my #DBS:

people use alt-tab eg. on windows to switch task. The brain seems to
have a generic pattern for "switching tasks" also in real life. If they once
have that specific pattern on your #Neuralink or #DBS they know that
you are goING to do something else.

They can attach EventTriggers on that to annoy me...

Maybe they created that for military purpose, to recognize when a Sniper
would like to pull the trigger...

Brainwaves: dy/dt ?
