YOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO
BE HAPPY ALL THE TIME.
Life hurts and it's hard.
Not because you're doing
it wrong, but because it
hurts for everybody.
Don't avoid the pain.
You need it. It's meant
for you. Be still with it,
let it come, let it go, let
it leave you with the fuel
you'll burn to get your
work done on this earth.
