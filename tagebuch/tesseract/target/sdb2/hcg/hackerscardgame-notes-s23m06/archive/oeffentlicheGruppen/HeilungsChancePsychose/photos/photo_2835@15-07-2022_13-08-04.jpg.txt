FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Mad Pride continues today, situated within the lineage of the
consumer/survivor/ex-patient (c/s/x) movement. Many new
organizations have been founded in the decades since, with
some identifying as "Mad Pride" groups, and others bridging
visions and solidarity across other movements. The following
opportunities for future growth have been identified:

Deconstructing racism, ableism, & other forms of oppression

The potential to bridge Mad Pride with Disability Justice, Racial
Justice, and other movements is largely untapped and necessitates
reflecting on Mad Pride's lack of intersectional analysis historically.

Embracing diversity of language and identity

Mad Pride allows people to embrace their "mad gifts," but has also
led to the arbitrary exclusion of those who use different language or
identify with diagnostic or disability-based frameworks.
