WHAT IS MAD PRIDE?

Mad Pride is a person-centered movement that believes it’s.
important to empower people to make their own choices,
recognizing that there isn’t a one size fits all approach to
living with mental health challenges. Members of the Mad
Pride movement may also identify themselves as
psychiatric survivors, referencing a long history of abuse
and mistreatment at the hands of unscrupulous members of
the psychiatric profession.
They argue that madness
is a natural facet of the
human condition, and
something to be cherished
as part of someone’s
identity — some are not
interested in medication
and other treatments.
