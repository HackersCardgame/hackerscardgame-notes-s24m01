of the changes in the phase of the wavefront [36,39]. In this work, we imaged the different microspheres using Zemike
phase-contrast imaging in a benchtop nano-CT scanner (Kradia Ultra 810). Phase-contrast nano-CT was used to
characterize the inner structure of the commercial product Risperdal Consta® (Figure 9) and the developed
microcapsules and microgels (Figure 10). Videos Supplementary Videos S1-S5 show the inner 3D structure of the

microparticles. The diameter and volume distributions of the intemal structures are presented in Supplementary
Figures S1 and S2.

Figure 9. Volumetric representation the inner part of one reconstructed microsphere of Risperdal Consta®
imaged with nano-CT. The left picture shows the Xray signal in gray and the microsphere PLGA matrix
pseudocolored in yellow On the right, the small colored structures represent the dispersed intemal spherical
structures (ISS). which can be attributed to the dispersed drug particles. The volume of the ISS is about 13% of
the total volume of the particle
