Here's one where they replaced the hard drive firmware.

ry

There was a talk at OHM this year [0HM2013] where a guy talked about replacing
hard drive firmware. You were onto something. You were really onto something.
Whoever you are, you were onto something. Because the NSA has a program here,
IRATEMONK, and that's exactly what they do. They replace the firmware in the hard
drive, so it doesn't matter if you reformat the hard drive, you're done. The firmware
itself can do a whole bunch of stuff

So, Here are the names of the hard drive companies were k works: SRIRHH Digital
Seagate, Maxtor and SEMEN, and of course they support FAT, NTFS, EXT3 and
UFS. They probably now have support for additonal fle systems, bu this is what we
can prove

Please note at the bottom left and the bottom right: “Status: Released and Deployed,

Ready for Immediate Delivery”. And "Unit Cost: $0”. Is free.
No, you can't get it. Its not froe as in free sofware, I's free as in you're owned.
