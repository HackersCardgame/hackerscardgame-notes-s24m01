“Without mud, you cannot have a
lotus flower. Without suffering, you
have no ways in order to learn how to
be understanding and compassionate.
Happiness is the lotus flower, and the
suffering is the mud. So the practice is
how to make use of the suffering,
make use of the mud, to create the
flower, the happiness, and this is
possible.”

— Thich Nhat Hanh (via
