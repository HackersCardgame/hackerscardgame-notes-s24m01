My nigga Edi had a son, we all happy
Cause now that little ridah got to deal
with eight daddies
My niggas cry, we all cry, and all ride
To rectify the problem, motherfuckers,
they all die
Been tryin to make a million by hustlin
since my adolescence
From crack dealin to rap villian, my
new profession

\ Who wanna see me at 8D, fuck 3D (
You coward ass motherfuckers ll never
see me
Bustin’ with automatic straps, my raw
raps like good crack
Niggas fiendin’, | got “em comin back
Until | die, they label me as a ridah
Forever, my niggas be together

Ain't shit without your homeboys

Riservatezza
