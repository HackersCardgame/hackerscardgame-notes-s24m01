inWentOr eh Weizenbaum

Joseph Weizenbaum, inventor of ELIZA, Developer of
First US Air Deffence System, Humanist, ... found one
of the best language hacks i ever heard: "Krieg
ist der Feind" (german: War is the Enemy). | extended
it so that younger people also understand what i think
he meant. "Not USA is the enemy, not russia is the
enemy, not ost timor is the enemy, the act fighting
against each other is the enemy" there are good
and bad people in all coutries, religions, skin colors,
companies...

i bought "Rebel at Work" and "Krieg ist der Feind" from
Joseph Weizenbaum and i'm satisfied with this two
products
