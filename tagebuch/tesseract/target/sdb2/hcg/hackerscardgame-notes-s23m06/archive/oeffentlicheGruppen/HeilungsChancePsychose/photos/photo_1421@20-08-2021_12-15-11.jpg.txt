sure 2: “TEM images of the agglomerated graphene sheets. The same sample region is viewed
at different magnifications and clearly shows the degree of sheet formation and the tendency of
sheets to fuse into overlapping regions. An inherent sheet-like structure is evident showing an
intricate array of long-range pleats. Since the images are taken in transmission mode, the relative
opacity of the individual sheets is the result of interfacial regions with overlap between individual
sheets. The sheets extend in lateral dimensions on micrometer length scales, ranging from 100 nm
to more than 1,000 nm,

‘The TEM images of the RD1 sample in general PRESENT A HIGH SIMILARITY with images
of graphene oxide from the literature obtained by the same TEM technique, with similar
magnifications. An intricate matrix or mesh of folded translucent flexible sheets can be observed,
with a mixture of darker multilayer agglomerations and lighter colored unfolded monolayers.
Darker linear areas appear due to local overlap of sheets and local arrangement of individual sheets
in parallel to the electron beam. After the mesh, a high density of unidentified rounded and
elliptical clear shapes appears, possibly corresponding to holes generated by mechanical forcing of
the mesh during treatment. We show here 3 images with progressive magnification:
