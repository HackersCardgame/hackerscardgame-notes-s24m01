The biological model of ‘mental health’ is highly
questionable and dubious from scientific
and philosophical perspectives.

We cannot continue to conceptualise

mental distress as a symptom to be eradicated
like a medical disease and ignore the political
and economic facts that neoliberalism

and capital are the real

major reasons for misery.

Disease and illness can only affect the body.
“Mental illness” is a metaphor.

Minds can be “sick” only in the sense

that jokes are “sick” or economies

are “sick.”

-Thomas Szasz-

That mental illnesses don't literally exist,
that the science behind psychiatry is not

a real science and that psychiatry is actually
a branch of the legal system rather than

a discipline of medicine.

That mental illnesses are created by our environments,
our society and our relationships with others,

not by problems in our brains or bodies;

this can be true on the level of abusive personal
relationships

or oppressive political and economic relationships
David Cooper most famously argued

that capitalist exploitation caused

mental breakdown in the working class
