Sons have often problems with their fathers. Fathers often
bully their sons, they abuse them, torture them, attack them
(no matter if physically or verbally) After a while the son is
old enough to defend himself, the justice system is norally
not very interested in this things, but this causes the sons to
become evil, i deh ean this behavior from their father,
and are doing the e to eel lageeas because they
learned that it is "legitimate" to do

This behavior (psychology: introjection) then would be the
normal case and would feed problems into the wohle social
systems (also m102 karte) and finally hits also daughters too
