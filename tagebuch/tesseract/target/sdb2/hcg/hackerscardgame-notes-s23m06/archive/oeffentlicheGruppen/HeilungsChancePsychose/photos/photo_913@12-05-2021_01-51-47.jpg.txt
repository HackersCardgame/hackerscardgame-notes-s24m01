To set people to freze mode or maybe even remote control
them, "dissociative identity disorder". "Identity" would acuse
the victim on the psychological layer. After they used it they
start electronic psychological warfare to obfuscate that i've
possibly just been dissociated. If you search the Internet you
will often find sources that say, that Dissociative Disorders
come from PTSD and from beeing raped in early childhood,
but this would be mos4 card to obfuscate Neuralink
Implants and to defend and hide the *EVENTTRIGER*
Neurologists that implemented them. | used "defend"
because it is not clear to me if these people are good or
evil. EVENTTRIGGER Neurology Implants: *cAPI $herNo1*
*Disso Patientinnen wurde mich unter Disso vergewaltigen*
(victim blaming)... -> Transitive (math) Concept: The death of
the topmost would drive the whole group to commit suicide.
Maybe intentionally to defend this such a "Hitler"? One shuold
not build such systems, this would be some sort of terrorism.
