it. Part of that is because they don’t have a clue, and another part of it is because they
can’t talk about it because they don’t have a political solution. Absent a political
solution, it’s very difficult to get someone to admit that there is a problem.

Well, there is a problem, so we're going to create a political problem and also talk
about some of the solutions.

The Cypherpunks generally have come up with some of the solutions when we talk
about encrypting the entire internet. That would end dragnet mass surveillance in a
Sabpbut it will come back in a different sense even with encryption aN EIU)
marriage of a technical solution and we need a political solution to go with it, and if we
don’t have those two things, we will unfortunately be stuck here.

But at the moment the NSA, basically, | feel, has more power than anyone in the entire
world — any one agency or any one person. So Emperor Alexander, the head of the
NSA, really has a lot of power. If they want to right now, they'll know that the IMEI of
this phone is interesting. It's very warm, which is another funny thing, and they would
be able to break into this phone almost certainly and then turn on the microphone, and
all without a court.

So that to me is really scary. And | especially dislike the fact that if you were to be
building these types of things, they treat you as an opponent if you wish to be able to
fulfill the promises that you make to your customers. And as someone who writes
security software, | think that’s bullshit.

So. Here’s how they do a bit of it.
