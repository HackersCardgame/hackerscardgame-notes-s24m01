YOU MAY WANT TO
FORGIVE YOUR PARENTS FOR:

* Raising you through their own unresolved trauma.

* Not being able to understand you, because they did not

have the capacity to.

* Not being able to teach you certain skills, as nobody
taught them.

* Being emotionally unavailable, as their parents were
emotionally unavailable.

Â» Doing the best they could with what
they knew and had.

* Following cultural norms that
they were surrounded with.

* Raising you through their own
struggles, worries, pain, and
fears.
