“In many shamanic societies, if
you came to a medicine person
complaining of being

disheartened, dispirited, or
depressed, they would ask ~
_ one of four questions: When
' did you stop dancing? When
_ did you stop singing? When ~
“did you bel being enchanted 7
by stories? When did you
stop finding comfort in the
sweet territory of silence?" 2
