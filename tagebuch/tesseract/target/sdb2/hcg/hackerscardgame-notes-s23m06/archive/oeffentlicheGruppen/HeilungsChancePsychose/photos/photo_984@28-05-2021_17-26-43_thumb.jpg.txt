th-a-synthett This Sensor can
detect light, Infrared, Electromagnetism â€”(x,.2),
Temperature, Sound... and it has synthetic sensor
(calculated dyln\/at) those things will then

So it can detect for example
that you enabled the microwave oven
(Electromagnetism & Sound of the fan that cools down
the Magnetron). unfortunately Satan can also detect if a
inncoent iri uses her private epilator. If it is enabled
and disabled over a period more than 10 minutes. it
would be likely they then add pedophile old ugly people
to her / his stream non-consensually because this is
formally a vulnerable phase where Satan would like to
abuse this weekness.
