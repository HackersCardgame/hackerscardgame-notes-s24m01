Here’s another one.

This one’s called SWAP. In this case it replaces the Host Protected Area of the hard drive, and you
can see a little graph where the target systems, see the internet, Interactive OPS, so they’ve got
like a guy who is hacking you in real time, the People’s Liberation Army, uh, NSA, and -

[laughter]

And you can see all of these different things about it. Each one of these things, including
SNEAKERNET, these are different programs, most of which we revealed today in Der Spiegel. But
you'll notice that it’s Windows, Linux, FreeBSD and Solaris.

How many Al Qaeda people use Solaris, do you suppose?

This tells you a really important point. They are interested in compromising the infrastructure of
systems, not just individual people. They want to take control and[[f@ielmenieem ees eens
with these implants. And that’s not part of the discussion. People are not talking about that
because they don’t know about that yet. But they should. Because in addition to the fact that Sun
is a U.S. company which they are building capabilities against - that to me, really, it really bothers
me; | can’t tell you how much that bothers me - we also see that they're attacking Microsoft,
another U.S. company, and Linux and FreeBSD, where there are a lot of people that are building it
from all around the world. So they’re attacking not only collective efforts and corporate effort, but
basically every option you can possibly can, from end users down to telecom core things.

Here’s another one, DEITYBOUNCE. This is for Dell, so Dell PowerEdge 1850, 2850, 1950, 2950
RAID servers using any of the following BIOS versions. Right. So just in case you're wondering,
hey Dell, why is that? Curious about that. Love to hear your statements about it.
