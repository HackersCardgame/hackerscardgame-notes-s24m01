RESULTS: DESCRIPTION OF THE TEMUIMAGES OF THERDI/PROBLEM SAMPLE

“The TEM images ofthe RDI sample in general PRESENT A HIGH SIMILARITY with images
of graphene oxide from the literature obtained by the same TEM technique, with similar
‘magnification. An inicate matrix or mesh of folded translucent flexible sheets can be observed,
‘wih a mixture of darker mulilayer agglomerations ad lighter colored unfolded monolayers

Darker linear areas appear dv local overapof sheets and local arrangement of individ sheets
{in parallel othe electron beam. After the mesh, «high density of unidentified rounded and
lliptca clea shapes appears, possibly coresponding to hoes generated by mechanical forcing of
the mesh during treatment. We show bere 3 images with progressive magnliation:
