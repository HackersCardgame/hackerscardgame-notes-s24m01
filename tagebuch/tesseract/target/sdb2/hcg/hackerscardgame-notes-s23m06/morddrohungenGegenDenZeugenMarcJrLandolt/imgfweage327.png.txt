Behavior [edit]

Contents [hide] Clark Hull found inspiration for his own theory of learning after learning about Ivan Pavlov’s idea of conditional reflexes, and Watson's system of

(Top) behaviorism.['5] He also was impacted by Edward Thorndike, as he adapted his theory to include and agree with Thorndike's law of effect.!'5] After Hull
Early life discovered his interest in learning theories from Pavlov, Watson, and Thorndike, he dedicated much of his own laboratory work to perfecting his own
theory. Also, many experiments concerning his learning theory came from Hull's students, who carried out many different experiments in Hull's lab after

Hypnosis In his book, Principles of Behavior," he developed the following formula:

gEp is excitatory potential (likelinood that the organism would produce response r to stimulus s),
Hr is the habit strength (derived from previous conditioning trials),

References V is stimulus intensity dynamism (some stimuli will have greater influences than others, such as the lighting of a situation),
Further reading and K is incentive (how appealing the result of the action is).[8Ii19)

A variety of other factors were gradually added to the formula to account for results not included by this simple function. Eventually the formula became:

Hull originally intended to make a trilogy of books on behavior, explaining social and cognitive behavior.|°! Instead, he focused on continuously revising his
original formula as exceptions showed up.°!

Hull's emphasis was on experimentation, an organized theory of learning, and the nature of habits, which he argued were associations between a stimulus
and a response.|°l Behaviors were influenced by goals that sought to satisfy primary drives—such as hunger, thirst, sex, and the avoidance of pain. His
