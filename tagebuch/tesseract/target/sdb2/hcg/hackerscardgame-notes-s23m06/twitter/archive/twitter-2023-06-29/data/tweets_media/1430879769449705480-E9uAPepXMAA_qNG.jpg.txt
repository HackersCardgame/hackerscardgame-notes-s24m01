If one would find the older people that bought eg. an
IBM System 3850 in the early days of modern
computing, we could maybe find out who did all this
bad things that happens in the world today.
Psychological Profile of such a person would match
to rich people and therefor maybe also not the nicest
people. This would only be the first guess. If i would
be rich i would give all my money to save the world,
since there are still many problems on this world i
bet iam not completely wrong with my first guess.

Could we find out who bought this sort of mass
storage or other expensive? computer equipment in
the old days???
