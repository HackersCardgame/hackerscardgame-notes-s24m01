The (neuro-) endocrine system is highly complex. So
one can influence behavior and health with
homeopactic doses of chemical substances, but also
with behavior or radiation. For me it is to complex to
understand and im not sure if a doctor in
endocrinology completely understands what would
happen when you change just a small element in the
complete system. If there is such a Al that helps the
doctors to make patients healthy again it would
maybe also subect to attacks. So hopefully some
doctors are hackers to. | dont know a lot about
medicine, but when i asked @unibas if they had a
look at the insulin pumps they recommend to their
doctors and students they did not answer. That was
a few years ago when CCC talked about such things.
