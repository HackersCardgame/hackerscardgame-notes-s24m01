to do something like intercepting 7 billion people all day long with no problem, and the

rest of us are not even allowed to experiment for improving the security of our own

lives without being put in prison or under threat of serious indictment, and that | think is

a really important point.

So the TURMOIL system is a surveillance system, and it is a dragnet surveillance
system that is a general warrant dragnet surveillance if there ever was one.

And now we shot the British over this when we started our revolution. We called them
“general writs of assistance.” These were generalized warrants which we considered
to be a tyranny. And TURMOIL is the digital version of a general writ of assistance
system. And the general writ of assistance itself, it's not clear if it even exists, because
it’s not clear to me that a jU@g8 (We"eJunderstand anything that | just said.

Okay, so now we're going to get scary. So that's just the passive stuff. There exists
another system that’s called TURBINE, and we revealed about this system in the
Spiegel publication today as well. So if TURMOIL is deep packet inspection, then
TURBINE is deep packet injection. And it is the system that combined together with
the things — with TURMOIL and TURBINE you can create a platform which they have
consolidated which they call QFIRE. QFIRE is essentially a way to programmatically
look at things that flow across the internet that they see with TURMOIL and then using
TURBINE they're able to actually inject packets to try to do attacks, and I'll describe
some of those attacks in detail in a moment.
