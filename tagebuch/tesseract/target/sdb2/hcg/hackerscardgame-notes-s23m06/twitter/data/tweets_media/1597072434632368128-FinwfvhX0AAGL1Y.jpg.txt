Signal analyzer system

Abstract

US4041461A

United States

A signal analyzer system is disclosed which includes an arithmetic processor containing a plurality
of pipeline processor elements in parallel array with each element connected to a respective working
store, with all of the elements being under microprogram control of an arithmetic element controller.

A storage controller included in the system is connected to the arithmetic processor, to a system Find Prior Art Similar
input and to a system ouput.
‘A bulk storage included in the system is connected to the storage controller. The storage controller Inventor: Gary L. Kratz, Wiliam W. Sproul, Il, Eugene T
