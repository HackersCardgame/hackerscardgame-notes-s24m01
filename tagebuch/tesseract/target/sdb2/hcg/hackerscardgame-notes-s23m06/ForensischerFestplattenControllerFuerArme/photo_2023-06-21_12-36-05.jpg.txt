hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
your next pull:

git config pull.rebase false # merge (the default strategy)
git config pull.rebase true # rebase
git config pull.ff only # fast-forward only

You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,

or --ff-only on the command Line to override the configured default per

invocation.

fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.
