people keep trying to make "ladies and
gentlemen" more inclusive.

| think we should go the other way around.

make more and more weird false dichotomies

in greetings. "gamers and pianists’. "oil

painters and swordsmen”. "vexillologists and

entomologists". "chess masters and diamond

artificers”. "accountants and gendered
individuals".

we need to be dropping shit into formal
meetings to make people say "wait what? which
one am |?”
