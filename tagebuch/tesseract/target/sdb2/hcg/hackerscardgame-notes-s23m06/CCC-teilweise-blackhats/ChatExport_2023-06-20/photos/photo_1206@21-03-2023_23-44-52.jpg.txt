difficult to label neatly. It has its own values and legends and folk heroes, partly overlapping with
those of the Unix tradition and partly derived from other sources. It has most often been called the
“hacker culture”, and since 1998 has largely coincided with what the computer trade press calls “the
‘open source movement”.

The relationships between the Unix tradition, the hacker culture, and the open-source movement
are subtle and complex. They are not simplified by the fact that all three implicit cultures have
frequently been expressed in the behaviors of the same human beings. But since 1990 the story of
Unix is largely the story of how the open-source hackers changed the rules and seized the initiative
from the old-line proprietary Unix vendors. Therefore, the other half of the history behind today’s
Unix is the history of the hackers

At Play in the Groves of Academe: 1961-1980

The roots of the hacker culture can be traced back to 1961, the year MIT took delivery of its first
PDP-1 minicomputer. The PDP-1 was one of the earliest interactive computers, and (unlike other
machines) of the day was inexpensive enough that time on it did not have to be rigidly scheduled.
It attracted a group of curioudlsiden the Tech Me ailfoad CHUB ho experimented with

the early days of the club, Their most famous achievement was SPACEWAR, a game of dueling

‘Several of the TMRC experimenters later went on to become core members of the MIT Artificial
Intelligence Lab, which in the 1960s and 1970s became one of the world centers of cutting-edge
computer science. They took some of TMRC’s slang and in-jokes with them, including a tradition

the first to describe themselves as “hackers”.

After 1969 the MIT AI Lab was connected, via the early ARPANET, to other leading computer
science research laboratories at Stanford, Bolt Beranek & Newman, Carnegie-Mellon University and
elsewhere. Researchers and students got the first foretaste of the way fast network access abolishes
‘geography, often making it easier to collaborate and form friendships with distant people

than it would be to do likewise with colleagues closer-by but less connected,
