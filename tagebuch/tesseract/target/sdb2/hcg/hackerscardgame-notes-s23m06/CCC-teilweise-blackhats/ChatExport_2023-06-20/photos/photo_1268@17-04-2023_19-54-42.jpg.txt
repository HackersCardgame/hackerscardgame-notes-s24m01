What do i need sulfuric acid in satisfactory for?

In Satisfactory, a game developed by Coffee Stain Studios,
sulfuric acid is an important resource used in various advanced
production processes. It is a key component in manufacturing
several items and materials that are essential for progressing
through the game. Some of the main uses for sulfuric acid in
Satisfactory include:

1. Alumina Solution Production: Sulfuric acid is used to produce
Alumina Solution, which is an essential ingredient in crafting
Aluminum products, such as Aluminum Ingots, Alclad
Aluminum Sheets, and Aluminum Casings.

2. Battery Production: Batteries are used in various applications
like vehicles, drones, and power storage. Sulfuric acid is a key
component in the production of batteries, along with Alumina
Solution, Aluminum Casings, and Lithium.

3. Uranium Processing: When you reach the nuclear power stage
in the game, you will need sulfuric acid for uranium
processing. Itis used to create Uranium Pellets, which are
further processed into Encased Uranium Cells, a necessary
component for Nuclear Fuel Rods and nuclear power
generation.

4. Turbo Motor Production: Turbo Motors are advanced
components used to construct high-tier buildings and
vehicles. Sulfuric acid is required in the manufacturing
process of Cooling Systems, which are then combined with
other components to produce Turbo Motors.

5. Sulfuric Acid Pipeline: In some cases, you may need to
transport sulfuric acid through pipelines to distant production
facilities. Building a pipeline network can help you supply
sulfuric acid to various production lines that require it.

Itis crucial to set up an efficient production chain for sulfuric acid
to ensure a steady supply for your advanced manufacturing
processes. Keep in mind that the in-game recipes and
production chains may change over time or vary depending on
game updates and balancing efforts.
