116. AUTOMATIC STRIP

Open Closed

As the base opens it pulls a strip. The automatic pull-strip can be used to
raise a flap or pop-up mechanism in the middle of one of the pages.

‘Thread the strip through both slits A, then stick tab B on the strip to B on the
base. The length C must be greater than length D. The movement generated at E
is exactly double length D.

AUTOMATIC FLAP

Construction method:
Stick A on the flap to A on the base. Thread the strip through the two slits B.
Stick C on the strip to C on the flap. Put glue on tab D, then close the base and
press firmly, tab D finds its correct sticking place E.

Measurements: F must be greater than G. G can't be less than H.
To flip flap right over G = H. To lift flap at an angle, G is greater than H.

‘These lengths can be adjusted so that
‘when the base is open the flap stands
vertically on the base, then
parallelogram Mechanisms (see 99)
‘can be built onto the flap.
