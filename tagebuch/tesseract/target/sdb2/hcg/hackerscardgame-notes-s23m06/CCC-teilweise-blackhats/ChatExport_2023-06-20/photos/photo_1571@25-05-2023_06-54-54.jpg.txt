“Thete are some exceptions to thal, but the CFAA in the United Slates, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act you
know, sso draconan for regular people, and the NSA ges o do something ie intercepting 7 baion people a

So the TURMOIL system ia survestnce system, and It's a dragnet surveitance system thats a general
warrant dragnet surveilance# there ever was one

‘And now we shot he Bish over tis when we started our revolution, We called them “general wis of
assistance” These were generaled warrants which we consiered to bea tyranny, And TURMOIL isthe cgtal
version of general wi of assistance system And the general wi of assistance ise snot clear ft even

Otay, so now we're going o get scary. So that's ust the passive stuf There ess anctner system that's called
TURBINE and we revealed about his system i he Spiege!pubscation loday as well So TURMOIL is deep
packet inspection, then TURBINE is deep packe nection. And its the system tat combined together wn the
things - wth TURAL and TURBINE you cn create a platform which they have consolidated which they call
GFIRE GFIRE is essentaly away to pogranmateay look a tnngs thal fw across the ntemel thal ey see
win TURMOIL and then using TURBINE they're abe to actualy inect packets fo tr to do attacks, and
Sescribe some of hose atlacks in deta in 3 moment

Bul essematy the interesting hing about QFRE ais is thal they have ating thas called a BE So it you
have for exampie a large number of systems where you canal them. you might sy, "Hey, wha ae you dong on
thal backbone?” “Hey, whats going on wih these systems?” And they coud say. wel, you know, me ald for
access, wete doing is, Is al legal, ecetera.GFIRE has iis really neat ite deal which sha hey
Compromise other people's rouers and then redirect bough them 30 that hey can beal the speed of ight

‘Ad how they do that i that hey have a passive sensor thats nearby a hing thal they can inject fom. ang when
they see that ining sees a selector thats interesting 1o them ori doing a thing thal hey would sk fo tamper
win in some way then they take a packel, they encapsulate te packet. they send itt the BRM, which might be
{your home router potently and then that home router decapsuiates that packet and sends tout And because
that's ver close fo you, and lets say youre visting Yahoo, then the Yahoo packet wil not beat you. Tats
they wil not beat the NSA or GCHO. So is a race condition. And 80 they basealy are able fo contr his whole
system and then locale alacksn that process

So that's a pretty — pretty scary stu, actualy And while t's a dgta thing, | hink it's important to understand
thal his wha Jeflerson takes abou! when he talked about tyranny This urnkey tyranny. and t's not has
coming i's actualy here's ust merely a queston about whether or not tey'use in away tal we think sa
good way or nota good way

Cone of he scariest parts about this tha fortis system or these sels of systems to eis. we have Been kept
\inerable So Its the case thal he Chinese, lhe Russians. people here wis to bul hs system, there's
nothing that stops them And infact the NSA has in a Meral sense retarded the process by which we would
Secute the interet ecause establishes a hegemony of power, tel power in secret fo do these things. And a
factve seen evdence that shows tha here are o many compromises taking place between tne dilerent Five
