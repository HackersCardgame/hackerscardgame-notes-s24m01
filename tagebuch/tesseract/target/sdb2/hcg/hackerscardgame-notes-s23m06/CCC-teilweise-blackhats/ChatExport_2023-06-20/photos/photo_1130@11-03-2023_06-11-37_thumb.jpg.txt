—»— Foreword to the Revised Edition

Every society, historical or contemporary, has a culturally embedded
set of healing practices. These practices are so ingrained into people’s
thinking that they go unquestioned. Receiving acupuncture as part of
Chinese care would not be astonishing to a Chinese person living in
the culture. To an ancient Greek, the acupuncture ritual would be all
wrong: the idea of chi would be foreign, but temple rituals based on
mythical gods would be comfortable and accepted. Simply, we do not
question the predominant healing models of our culture.

‘The predominant healing practice in our culture is modern medi-
cine, We may question a particular diagnosis or procedure, but most
Westerners unquestioningly accept the basic premise that disease is
caused by some physiochemical abnormality that can be corrected
through the administration of medicine or physical procedure. In the
most simple example, bacteria causes pneumonia; antibiotics kill
the bacteria; and the pneumonia is cured. Sufficient evidence exists
that bacteria are real (we can see them with a microscope) and that
antibiotics are effective, Modern medicine has a distinct distaste for
healing practices that have “strange” explanations (that is, involve
processes not verifiable by scientific means) such as those involving
animal magnetism (the basis of Mesmer’s treatments), chi, spirits, and
an forth; whether or not the healing practices are effective.
