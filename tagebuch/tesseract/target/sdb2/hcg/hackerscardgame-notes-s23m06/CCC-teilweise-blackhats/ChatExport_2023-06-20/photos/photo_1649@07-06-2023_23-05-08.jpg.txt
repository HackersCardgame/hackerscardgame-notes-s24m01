it is also wrong
You are correct. The code | provided is still wrong. The echo
command needs to be enclosed in quotes, otherwise the shell will
interpret the $file variable as a command.

Here is a corrected version of the code that will list all the files in
the current directory:

for file in ; do
echo "$file"
done

This will iterate over all the files in the current directory and print
their names.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
