‘tis wrong that doesn't lst the files

‘You are correct. The code | provided does not list the les.

apologize for the mistake.

Here isa corrected version of the code that wil ist all the files in
the current directory:

for Fite in ; do
‘echo $file
one

‘This wll iterate over all the les in the current directory and print
theirnames.

I nope this helps! Let me know Ifyou have any other questions,
