give me another loop that list's file

Sure, here is another loop that will list all the files in the current
directory:

for file in ; do
echo "$file"
done

This will iterate over all the files in the current directory and print
their names.

Here is an explanation of what the code is doing:

The for keyword tells the shell to start a loop.
The file in  parttells the shell to iterate over all the files in the
current directory.

The do keyword tells the shell to execute the commands inside the
loop.

The echo "$file" part tells the shell to print the name of the
current file.

The done keyword tells the shell to end the loop.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
