Currently, the only implemented method in cvHoughCircles() is CV_HOUGH_GRADIENT
4 80,

param - refers to the edge threshold that will be used by the Canny edge detector (applied to a
grayscale image). cvCanny() accepts two thresholds and is internally invoked by
évHoughCircles() . Therefore the higher (first) threshold is set to param1 (passed as argument
A into cvslougheiretes() ) and the lower (second) threshold is set to half of this value.

param2 - Is the value for accumulator threshold. This value is used in the accumulator plane that
must be reached so that a line is retrieved.

I would recommend you to read this book, which is in my opinion the best one describing Opencv.

Thope this helps.
