DEMONIGHTS 017: Back at
MakeZurich 2023

The Demonights train stops again at this year's MakeZurich hackathon. Unlike
Demonights 11 (MakeZurich edition), we'll be on site for proper demo watcher
experience. MakeZurich is a weeklong hackathon for the local maker community and
the city administration to improve life in the city. Without any doubts, a proper
demoshow pays in to that
