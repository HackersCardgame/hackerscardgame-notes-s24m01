â€˜The IBM 2321 Data Cell Drive was introduced in 1964, after years of development work, as a very large
capacity storage system. The total storage capacity was about 400 Mb.

The drive accomodated 10 removable and interchangeable data cells like the one shown above. Each data cell
contained 200 2.25" by 13" magnetic strips. After selection a strip was taken from the cell and wrapped around
1 drum. Average access times: selection of a strip from a cell 400 ms; rotational delay once a strip is on the
ddrum 25 ms; selecting a track 95 milliseconds, Reportedly the device worked not very reliably. It was also
supported by Control Data under the name of 2321 Strip File.

IBM 3850 Mass Storage System

This tape cartridge, 1.65" in diameter, 3.5" long and containing 770 inches of 2.75" wide magnetic tape, held
about about 50 Mbytes. Cartridges ofthis type were used in the IBM 3850 Mass Storage System. a tape robot
avant la lertre accomodating up to almost 10000 cartridges sitting in hexagonal pigeon holes.

Like modem video tap, the 3850 tapes were read and written by helical scanning. The 3850 was designed to
store images of the Model 3330 Disk File, Two cartridges would contain the image ofa 3336 disk pack. The
3850 MSS was introduced in 1974,
