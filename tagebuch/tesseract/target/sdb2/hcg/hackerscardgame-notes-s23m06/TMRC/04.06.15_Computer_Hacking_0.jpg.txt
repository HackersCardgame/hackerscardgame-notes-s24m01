Services curtailed

Telephone hackers active

By Henry Lichstein

Many telephone services have
been curtailed because of so
called hackers, according to Pro-
fessor Carlton Tucker, admi

straior of the Institute phone
system,
Stating “It means the students

who are doing this are depriving
‘the rest of you of privileges you
otherwise might have,” Prof.
Tucker noted that two or three
students are expelled each year
for abuses on the phone system.

The hackers have accomplished
such things as tying up all the
tienes between Harvard and
‘MIT, or making long-distance
calls by charging them t a local
radar installaion. One method in-
volved connecting the PDP
‘computer to ithe phone system to
search the lines until a dial tone,
indicating an outside line, was
found.

system to many areas without @

lines discovered have been ones
to the Millstone Radar Facility,
the Sudbury defense installation,
TBM in Kingston, New York, and
the MITRE Corporation.
Tucker warns hackers

Commenting on these incidents,
Prof. Tucker said “If any of
these people are caught (by the
telephone company) they are lia-
ble to be put in jail. I try to
warm them and protect them.”

While Tucker felt “ we don’t
have too much trouble with the
boys; We appreciate their cur-
fosity,”” he also said that repea- j
ted involvement, for instance,
caused the expulsion from the
Institute of one member of the
Class of "63 one week before his
graduation.

Because of the “hacking, the
majcrity of the MIT phones are
“trapped”. They are set up so
tie-line calls may not be made.
Originally, these tielines were
open to general_use.
