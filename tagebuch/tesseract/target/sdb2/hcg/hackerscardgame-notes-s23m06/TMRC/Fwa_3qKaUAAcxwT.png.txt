MC does not refer to Project Mac! While Macsyma was developed part of Project Mac,
Project Mac had multiple machines, and Macsyma was originally develooped on a
predecssor system, MIT-ML (ML for MathLab). MC stands for Macsyma Consortium, a
consortium with governmental and industry funding that purchased the faster and larger
DEC PDP KL-10 system.

Thank you for the correction, and | apologize for the confusion. Your clarification is much
appreciated.

As per your information, the MIT-MC stands for MIT Macsyma Consortium, which used the
DEC PDP KL-10 system for the development of Macsyma, the computer algebra system. This
took place after the initial development of Macsyma as a part of Project MAC on the MIT-ML.
(MathLab) system.

Regarding your query about Bob Kerns or "rwk@mit-mc", as of my knowledge cutoff in
September 2021, | don't have specific information about this individual and their role at the
MIT Macsyma Consortium. For the most accurate and recent details, I recommend seeking
out sources that have been updated more recently.
