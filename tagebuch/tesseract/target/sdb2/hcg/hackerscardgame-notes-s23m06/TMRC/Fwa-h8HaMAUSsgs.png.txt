MIT-MC was the site where Macsyma as developed. It had nothing to do with the Tech Model
Railroad Club.

My apologies for the confusion. You're correct. The MIT-MC you're referring to is indeed
associated with the development of the computer algebra system, Macsyma. In this context
the "MC" in MIT-MC would likely refer to MIT's Project MAC, where Macsyma was developed,
and not the Model Railroad Club.

Project MAC (the Project on Mathematics and Computation, later renamed to the Laborator}
for Computer Science) was a research project at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT) that brought many developments in computer science, including time-sharing
systems, computer graphics, and computer-human interaction.

Macsyma (or "MAC's SÂ¥mbolic MAnipulator") was one of the first computer algebra systems
developed in the late 1960s and 1970s at MIT's Project MAC. It was designed to perform
complex mathematical computations and symbolic manipulation of mathematical
equations.

I'm afraid | still don't have specific information on Bob Kerns, known online as "rwk," in
association with MIT-MC or Macsyma. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, you
would need to find more recent or specific sources for that information.
