Mental Institutions have Padded Cells or Isolation Cells
where they put patients in. | was several times in such a
Cell, the funny thing in Switzerland is, that the padded cell
is not even padded. They Say it's for people that would like
to commit suicide, they even lock victims with straight
jackets. It's about sensory deprivation, sensory deprivation
is psychological violence or also some sort of behavioral
"sciences". IMHO it would be better to put the people who
vicimized the victim into jail.

They do the same thing with your contacts, there are
several ways to isolate people from their social network
and even from their family. I'm not quite sure, but i guess if
they put you in a Isolation-Cell, the Network automatically
isolates you for example also in your Socail Network or the
Internet. On the other hand empirical value can't be taught
