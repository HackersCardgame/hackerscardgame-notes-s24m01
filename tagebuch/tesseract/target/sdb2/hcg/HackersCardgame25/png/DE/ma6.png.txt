Inventor:

As a Christian and psychology student, she saw that
the Nazis are killing Jews, patients in mental
institutions, innocents. She began to print flyers with
her brother, distributed them at her university to
stop Hitler. Unfortunately she and her brother was
sentenced to death by a Nazi judge and murdered by
the Nazis

May white roses materialize on her tomb

Opinion: German People be proud
for people like Sophie Scholl who had
that much courage not to give up
1980s Generation is anyway
innocent for what Hitler did
