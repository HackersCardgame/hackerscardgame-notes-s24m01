Inventor:

If your Hand suddenly begins with small movements on
the screen. (Ecriture automatique, return channel
mouse) they have already hacked your spinal cord
implant (medulla spinalis) and they are testing if they
can take over my telemetry. In my particular case they
beat my hands against my own head (there are movies
where autists do such things and there are special
helmets for that). After they sucessfully attacked you
they revictimize the scene (t10 card). And even if they
haven't killed me, it would influence me. Maybe this is
how they killed Tobias Moser, m46. And for the equal
aged friends of the victim this would have the effect of
psychological warfare (ma4). if they used dtl the real
offender say it is all your fault, if not they say it's
because you ate eg a cookie or drunk wine or other
stupid reasons and b1,t1...
