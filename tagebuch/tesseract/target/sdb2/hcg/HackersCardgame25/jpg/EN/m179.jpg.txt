Hacker

Inventor: 777

Stupid people seem to aggregate or to attack in
groups. see dt6 card!

If people attack in are groups it would be likely that
there are some that are able to eg. write c/c++ code
(real hacking) and many are not.

Inclusion principle would mean that you sould also
include those people that can not write code. And
unfortunately they did. They wrote some software that
seems to be primarily to annoy the real hackers. As
soon they have a communication channel to the target
(this tends to be me) they mansplain things like: "we
now hacked your computer because we can remotely
switch it on, hahaha" like today. The funny thing was,
that i unplugged the power cable of my desktop, so
this was a lie for weaken me before the real hackers
attack, i'm not sure what this tells us about the
aggregated blackhat team that attacks me...
