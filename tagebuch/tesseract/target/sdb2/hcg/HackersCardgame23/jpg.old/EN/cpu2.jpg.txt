Microdot

Inventor: XXXX Year! ~????
At some mn ce there is the famous talk "Hacker

ardy" ang poole: there is a Section

vintage erminals". In my opinion this
Section should) also include devices (such as
children's toys), because e.g. the DBS (t40,t41 Card)
seems to have a function to "call home" and the first
time i saw this Concept Knowledge was in the movie
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial in 1982. Such film scenes
are MicroDots for the "initiated" (mostly closed
source) to inform Parents about features of their
gear. The children would be put on another DBS
stream / content and then think, i already know that
with the "E.T. calling home", | don't have to think
about it any further.
