The communication between patient and patient
or between patient and medic or_ the
communication between patients and
psychiatric nurses are often ambigious. In my
opinion they (who) try that communication
between patients will be poisoned (m50). I
try to be unambiguously. But as soon as I use
to complicated words they call me imaginary
poser (maybe some stimulus reaction habit).
Such cards would maybe help, but i guess they
rendered "rage" on my cards... Hopefully at
least the medic to medic link works!

Maybe TURBINE / TARMOIL like for Neuralink /
Stimmoceiver? <- i dont think so, i guess
it's noramlly the parental generation, but
the parents are maybe driven by deep packet
injection.
