As soon they have your TODO list they start
to write psychological warfare  socio-
psychology design patterns for that specific
todo. Lock this item on my TODO's list until
this malware is finished and they use it as
â€œadditional selector" which seems to be more
some sort of booby-trap to hunt down
innocent people that are brave enogh to
speak out against satan.
