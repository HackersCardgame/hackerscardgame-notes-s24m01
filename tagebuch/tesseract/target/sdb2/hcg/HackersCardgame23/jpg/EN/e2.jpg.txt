Cavity magnetron

Inventor:

The cavity magnetron is a high-powered vacuum
tube that generates microwaves’ using’ the
interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic
field while moving past a series of open metal
cavities (cavity resonators). Electrons pass by the
openings to these cavities and cause radio waves to
oscillate within, similar to the way a guitar resonates
sound from its sound box via the oscillation of its
strings. see also t15 card

For Microwave Oven but unfortunately also for things
like Active Denial Systems (Another Card)
