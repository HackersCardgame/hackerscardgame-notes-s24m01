Well, QUANTUMINSERTION, this is also an important point, because this is what was
used against Belgacom, this is what’s used by a whole number of unfortunately
players in the game where basically what they do is they inject a packet. So you have
a TCP connection, Alice wants to talk to Bob, and for some reason Alice and Bob have
not heard about TLS. Alice sends an HTTP request to Bob. Bob is Yahoo. NSA loves
Yahoo. And basically they inject a packet which will get to Alice before Yahoo is able to
respond, right? And the thing is that if that was a TLS connection, the man-on-the-side
attack would not succeed. That's really key. If they were using TLS, the man-on-the-
side attack could at best, as far as we understand it at the moment, they could tear
down the TLS session but they couldn’t actually actively inject. So that’s a man-on-the-
side attack. We can end that attack with TLS. When we deploy TLS everywhere, then
we will end that kind of attack.

So there was a joke, you know, when you download .mp3s, Neen iubesnlil lsu
— from the’90s, some of you may remember this. When you bareback with the internet,

you ride with the NSA.
[applause]

Or you're getting a ride. Going for a ride.

So the TAO infrastructure, Tailored Access and Operations. Some of the FOXACID
URLs are public. FOXACID is essentially like a watering hole type of attack where you
go to a URL, QUANTUMINSERT puts like an iframe or puts some code in your web
