Witcn |) cies CHE ny G@amaicy dks Cooma i bo en There are several (most not working) methods how they try
algorithm that detects when my work is efficient and then to delete information in the brains of WhiteHats /
propel aera noice Whistleblowers, rape victims... c1, c2, a16, dtl, m22, m27,
m41, m44, ma5, m15, t10, co4, m42, but definitley m19.
Maybe deleting the scenes of a rape situation would help
the victim, maybe. Think of the drawing as a visual
representation (map) of the your brain and the purple part
is what they want to overwrite
Unfortunately brain is not two dimensional, so this would
maybe work for a while but, and ‘antipsychotics would
“help” to keep the victim silent, but in the end nothing is
really deleted and just reduces the intelligence. That's
where the 1960s People have great long-term job
opportunities in the survaillance business payed by the
perpetrator, but after a while this "maybe" fails to

The problems are not always in the same order, but
efficiency seems to be an eventtrigger that starts such

If you have a production line (that can be abused to
programm stimulus-response habits), the line can
have several different states, so you have to find the
states and how / when (eg. eventtrigger) they
change, see eg. Siemens S7 PCL

Antenna Shapes can be defined through their
Wavelength or the multiples and divisors of their A
(greek letter Lambda):

The frequencies of antennas can be calculated. A
golden wire in the body would have also a specific
frequency and could contract muscules. The only
legitimate experiment would be a self-experiment
and only if under medical surveillance. This would
also mean that Elon Musks Neuralink is possibly
prone to side band attacks directly to the wires of
the implant.

And if the kid / victim that was abused (abuse
obfuscation for human experiments) and
transformed in a bot and he would be to fast for the
people who did this to him / her they would send him
to smoke a cigaret (Stimulus-Reaction-Habit or
Electronic Harassment) so the can change things or
fake the protocol or steal prove.

If one smokes, its possibly also a victim of such
illegal human experiments. But it is also possible
that one of the offneders smoke to obfuscate his role
as culprit (a14 Card)

Behavioral "Sciences": They enable the pain
implant in the frontal lobe, and if you smoked they
disable it, so you smoke.

They have some sort of a 3D Model of victims, whistleblowers,
whitehat hackers, Lab Rats, Verdingkinder apartment where
they can set eventtriggers (tl4) or even create an atl out of
their victim. Generated from eg. RetinaCCD (eyel, a19,
Photogrammetry) or body telemetry (RFID in extremities) or an
‘older system like resonant cirquits. Maybe a persons position
could also be extrapolatet just from accustic data, for example
if you have more than 2 Laptops with microphone (see
1EEE1588) and a model of the apartment. They have also
access to my amygdala implant (b1) and at the same time
triggering cAPI (dt3) programmed in 2002 with something like
12, t2, t7, t32 card. The Apartment was selected by
SherFamily in 2002 (interactive, bidirectional, almost killed
me). | guess they are testing new systems, new socio-
psychological design-pattemns, new CyberWar equipment /
patterns. They seem to use Loops to “hide” things even police
is affected: they did not "saw" a laptop that was obvious on the
table, they also *hide" wound care material, and that is really

If a NSA/CIA would have access to all peoples data,
even the private diaries they would maybe install
some Al that analyzes what the whitehat hacker just
says, writes or thinks

Then they would try to match that on persons in his /
her network that would get a cogntivie dissonace
because of that sentence or concept knowledge
even when i dont write names in my diary

CIA would possibly know what person or eg. Meyer-
Briggs archetypes would rage because of what i just
written into my privat diary. So it would be possible
that the CIA/NSA would intentianally send this
private diary entries to people to "motivate" them to
attack me.

Lot of people live normal lives, living not as a saint but
also not a live as satan. They have their routine, their
places where they do things like hobbies and where they
look TV. But if one finds out, that his company sold a
software to a children hospital that would risk lifes of kids
and then tries to force the chief to fix that chiefs tend to
become angry about such an employee. When you are
young you are maybe not aware of such problems. A
normal reaction of the chief would be to intimidate the
‘employee to stay you are one of this sort of
people that can't silent, it is very likely to end up as a
homeless, but maybe you saved many lives of innocent
‘ds. In my case they used it about 6 Months to blackmail
me, they said when i would not be silent in my
appartment they would have a reason to kick me out, i
was silent, noted things in my diary, though my flat
