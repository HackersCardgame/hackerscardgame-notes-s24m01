heard. In 2013 the Schulkommandant of Waffenplatz
Wangen materialized at Schachenallee where i had a

smoke a cigaret (Ssmokel card). | begun to talk with
him and i used some sort of Social Engineering: |
asked "What are the fiber networks of the army used

made two mistakes in one sentece: "They are used
for the Marschbefehle". First he told me: "Yes there
are army fiber Networks in switzerland" second he
does not seem to be a gifted liar: "Marschbefehle are
more or less small Word documents... maybe they
use it for something else... i again ended up in m19.
