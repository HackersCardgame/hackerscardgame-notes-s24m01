Koffka, he began to work towards a neobehaviorism.'] His goal was to determine the laws of behavior and how they can
be used to determine future behaviors.!Il5] His work with the computing machine led him to believe a machine could be
built to replicate mental processes.!5)

In his book, Principles of Behavior,"4] he developed the following formula:

sER=sHa*DxVxK

Where:

sEp is excitatory potential (likelihood that the organism would produce response r to stimulus s),

Hk is the habit strength (derived from previous conditioning trials),

Dis drive strength (determined by, e.g., the hours of deprivation of food, water, etc.),

Vis stimulus intensity dynamism (some stimuli will have greater influences than others, such as the lighting of a situation),
and K is incentive (how appealing the result of the action is). [®Il"5)

A variety of other factors were gradually added to the formula to account for results not included by this simple function.
Eventually the formula became:

ER = V xD xKxJX Hp - Ip - sl - Or - slr

such that Ip is reactive inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that dissipates over time),
slp is conditioned inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that does not dissipate over

time).l"5] sLp is Reaction threshold, the smallest amount of reinforcement that will produce learning.
