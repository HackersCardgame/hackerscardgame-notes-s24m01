Abstract

"Brainjacking' refers tothe exercise of unauthorized control of another's electronic brain implant. Ceo
Whilst the possibilty ofhacking a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has already been proven in both

‘experimental and real-life settings, there is reason to believe that it will soon be possible to interfere

withthe software settings of the Implanted Pulse Generators (\PGs) that pay a central ole in Deep

Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems. Whilst brainjacking raises ethical concerns pertaining to privacy and

physica or psychological harm, we claim that the possibilty of brainjacking OBS raises particularly € Title & authors
profound concerns about individual autonomy, since the possibilty of hacking such devices raises the

prospect of third parties exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning the subject's Abstract
cognitive, emotional and motivational states. However, although it seems natural to assume that,

brainjacking represents a profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest thatthe implications of Figures
brainjacking fr individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by

brainjacking often serve to enhance certain aspects ofthe user's autonomy. The difficulty of Similar articles
ascertaining the implications of brainjacking DBS for individual autonomy is exacerbated by the varied

understandings of autonomy in the neuroethical and philosophical literature. In this paper, we seek to Cited by

bring some conceptual clarity to this area by mapping out some of the prominent views concerning
