Inventor:
* Access to computers—and anything which might teach you
something about the way the world works—should be
unlimited and total. Always yield to the Hands-On
Imperative!

* All information should be free

* Mistrust authority—promote decentralization

* Hackers should be judged by their hacking, not criteria
such as degrees, age, race, sex, or position

* You can create art and beauty on a computer

* Computers can change your life for the better
