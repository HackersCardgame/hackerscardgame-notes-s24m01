Permanent Record, PART 2 (Reason for)

They did not just let Snowden go with outdated documents, they also PLANNED
psychological Warfare in Context of the leaks. | was complaining 13 Years before
nowden that there is something WROGN WITH THE MATRIX um the Corporate
Network of the Company where i worked by the age of 20 Years

They try to make you think, that they are always watching you with the EventtTriggers, even if it is
"just" automated targeting. They seem to use EEG / DBS Data [m160 Card] and all other input sources they can
get. So especially people like me with autism become paranid. On one way the leaks helped the autistic people
on the other way it's some sort of psychological warfare because the try to suggest that there is
>> NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT << but even tin foil can make a difference. Being under surveillance
feels like being a fox on two legs that is being hunted permanently. This would make it impossible
(theoretically) for the Autistic Person to think about things like technology. German: Machterhalt.
One way to cope with that situation would be intelligence reducing drugs && / || ignorance. But after
they killed so many innocent people IGNRANCE IS NO CHOICE. Their favorite chess move seems to
be to go below the belt, against my sexual integrity, against people i love, against people that are younger
than me.
