If a person has to do all day the same, it is likely that
these moves are burnt into his psyche (not even an
implmant required) If you would give a stimulus (eg. high
noise sound at 15kHz, 16kKHz, 17kHz...) you could link this
move to a stimulus. t2, t11, formula see m76 Card.

So it would be likely that not only people like me that
worked in robotics (t22 Card) are affected.

It would be the same like m70 card or in combination with
m70 card.
