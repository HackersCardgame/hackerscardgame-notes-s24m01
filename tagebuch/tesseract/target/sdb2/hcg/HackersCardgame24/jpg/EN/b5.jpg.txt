Brodmann areas were originally defined and
numbered by the German anatomist Korbinian
Brodmann based = on_- the © cytoarchitectural
organization of neurons he observed in the cerebral
cortex using the Nissl method of cell staining.
Brodmann published his maps of cortical areas in
humans, monkeys, and other species in 1909,[1]
along with many other findings and observations
regarding the general cell types and laminar
organization of the mammalian cortex. The same
Brodmann area number in different species does not
necessarily indicate homologous areas.[2] A similar,
but more detailed cortical map was published by
Constantin von Economo and Georg N. Koskinas in
1925.[3]
