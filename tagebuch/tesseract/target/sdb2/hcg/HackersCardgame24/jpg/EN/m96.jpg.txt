| guess a lot people knew that the twin towers will fall. In my
opinion very likely that the people from CIA knew. If you look
at m95 the "war on terror" would have obfuscated perfectly
that the CIA begun to undemine Sateen ane since ae or
even since 1968. This two Ff

glasses i got from $1955sMarketingGuy @ ABB Flexible
Automation AG, ZH Altstetten in the year 2000. When he
gave them to me as a gift he said something like: "This
Glasses will be precious in the near future". With just a bit of
imagination one could the two glasses that were in a nice
blue cardboard as the twin-towers with the holes from the
airplanes. When i Asked $herFather / $herMother (there was
a time when i trusted them) in 2002 what they think about
my theory. They said "no, no of course nobody knew about
that the twin-towers will fall". What they said seemed to me
like a very very cheap lie. As soon as one begun to question
the official version people begun to discredit or even attack.
