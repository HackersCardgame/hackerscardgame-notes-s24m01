about tyranny. This is turnkey tyranny, and it’s not that it’s coming, it’s actually
here. It's just merely a question about whether or not they'll use it in a way that we
think is a good way or not a good way.

One of the scariest parts about this is that for this system or these sets of systems
to exist, we have been kept vulnerable. So it is the case that if the Chinese, if the
Russians, if people here wish to build this system, there’s nothing that stops them.
And in fact the NSA has in a literal sense retarded the process by which we would
secure the internet because it establishes a hegemony of power, their power in
secret to do these things. And in fact I've seen evidence that shows that there are
so many compromises taking place between the different Five Eyes signals
intelligence groups that they actually have lists that explain, “If you see this back
door on the system, contact a ffiendly agency. You've just recompromised the
machine of another person.”

So when we talk about this, we have to consider that this is designed for at-scale
exploitation. And as far as | can tell it's being used for at-scale exploitation. Which
is not really in my mind a targeted particularized type of thing, but rather it's
fishing operations. It’s fishing expeditions. It's more like fishing crusades, if you
will. And in some cases, looking at the evidence, that seems to be what it is.
Targeting Muslims, | might add, because that's what they’re interested in doing.

So that said, that’s the internet, and we get all the way down to the bottom and we
get to the Close Access Operations and Off-Net. Off-Net and Close Access
