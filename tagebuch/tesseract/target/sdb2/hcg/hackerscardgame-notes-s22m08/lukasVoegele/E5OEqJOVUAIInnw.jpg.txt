(57) ABSTRACT

Apparatus and method for remote manipulation of nervous
systems by the magnetic dipole field of a rotating bar
magnet. Reliance on modulation of spontaneous spiking
patterns of sensory nerve receptors, and exploitation of 4
resonance mechanism of certain neural circuits, allows the
use of very weak magnetic fields. This, together with the
large magnetic moments that can be obtained with a per-
manent bar magnet, makes it possible to effectively manipu-
late the nervous system of a subject over a distance of
several hundred meters, using a small portable battery-
powered device. The method can be used in law enforce-
ment for standoff situations.
