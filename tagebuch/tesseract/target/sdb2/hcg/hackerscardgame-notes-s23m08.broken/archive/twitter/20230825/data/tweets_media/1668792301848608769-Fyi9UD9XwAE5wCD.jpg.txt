Definitions in graph thoory vary. The folowing are some ofthe more basic ways of defining graphs and rolatod
‘mathomatical structures.

Graph [edi}
In one restricted but very common sense of the term, Ia graph is an ordered pair G = (V, E) comprising

+ V, a sot of vertices (also called nodes or points)

© EC {{2,9) | 2.y  V and 2 # y} , a sel of edges (also called links or lines), which are unordered pairs

of vertices (thats, an edge is associated with two distinct vertices).

‘To avoid ambiguity, this typeof object may be called procisoly an undirected simple graph
Inthe edge {, y}, the vertices 2 and y are called the endpoints of the edge. The edge is said to Join z and yy
{and tobe incident on 2 and on y. A vertex may exist in a graph and not belong to an edge. Multiple edges, not
allowed under the definition above, are two or more edges that join the same two vertices. i
