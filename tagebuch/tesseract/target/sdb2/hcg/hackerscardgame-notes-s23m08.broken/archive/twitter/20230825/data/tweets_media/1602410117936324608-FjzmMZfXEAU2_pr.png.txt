To sum up, in both cases, criminal reports were registered by the police
before the women had been formally interviewed, and in the case of S.

In both cases, it was falsely asserted that the women themselves had
intended to report a sexual offence against Assange, although this
demonstrably had not been their intention. As if to cover her back,

Wassgren detailed in her memo that she had consulted with various
departments and that ‘everyone’ had been ‘unanimous’ that this was
rape.
