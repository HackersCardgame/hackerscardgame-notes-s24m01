fas: 2 Why not the oppostte? Stream music from your brain nto a midi controler?

Location: Tarragona

My idea is to use 16 binary outputs from the chip input to trigger the 16 channels. Additionally you'd use 16 + other 16 analog outputs to send information about the note (12 range parts) and
the octave (10 range parts)

1 know this Is possible because of this video: https://www.youtub tch?v=qSKBLEBRWI¢

What are your thoughts? What software/hardware woud you need to transform the brain signal to @ midi signal?

‘Anew era of electronic music production is ahead of us, and it would a good thing to develop this idea in the mean time.
