The Concept is called Risky Shift which means that
decisions in groups are made riskyer because one does
not have to take the full responsibility for a specific
decision and he or she knows that the others could be
blamed if the decision is wrong. If you need to do
decisions in groups than pointing at the concept of
Risky Shift helps at least a bit to mitigate the problem.

Bad thing is that satan knows that too, so he ties to
force people to make worng decisions in groups
(m37=dt1 card sequence) to then blackmail the whole
group and use them more as NPC's or as "Soldiers"
than as humans.
