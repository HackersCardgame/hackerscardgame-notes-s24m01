Soldiers "learn" to obey orders, but calling it learning
would often be wrong; they are forced to obey orders.
This does not start in the army, it starts already in
primary school where kids learn that they must respect
the older person that is normally the teacher. Many
teachers use dirty shaming tricks in front of the
complete class to force students not to do criticism,
especially when criticism morally would be the right
thing. Also parents that do narcisstic power abuse are
not helpful to become a sane adult. We need to teach
soldiers that they are alowed to deny orders, for
example if the officier cammands you to kill innocent
child it's not only your right to deny this command, it's
your duty! If you deny a command it is likely that you
will be punished or shamed.
