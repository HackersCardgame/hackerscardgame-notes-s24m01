Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~????

In Switzerland they seem to have some sort of simulation
weapons like sniper rifle that is attached to a mainframe /
GPS. There they can virutally headshot people like me. If
the virtually killed me my DBS-Implant / neuralink / spinal
cord implant beats my fists against my own head, therefor
an helmet for autists is helpful. Other victims seem to cut
theirselfes, run suicide or amok.

| don't know how and when i got the implant, but first time
that happened was in WalterMerzWeg 6 Aarau. (m75 Card).

| guess that the weapon industriy hacks and owns the
hospital mainframe that should help the patients with the
DBS. Thats against the geneva conventions. The Offender
that uses this weapons seems to get incentives. The
system records that and blackmails the soldier with that
deed. Finally the use the Offender as assesin like a chat
friend from syria reported bevor the war begun.
