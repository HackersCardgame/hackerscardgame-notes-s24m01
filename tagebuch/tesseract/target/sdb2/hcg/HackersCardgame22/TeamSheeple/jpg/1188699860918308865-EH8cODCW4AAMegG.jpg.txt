Depending on the authorization (or the security
clearance) of a user, folders are shown or not shown ina
Windows Network. If you would implement that on a
client computer, you could do much more dirthy tricks.
For example if a Pedophilia Victim, a Torture Victim or a
Victim that was Subject to illegal Human Experiments
would find out who did that all to him they would maybe
want to keep the victim silent. So they would upload for
example pedophila Images on the computer of the victim,
call him a Terrorist for getting access to his computers,
and would find the pedophilia content. If the Victim would
look at the same Folder on his Computer, the Access
Based Ennumeration algorithm would hide this images,
so he would not know and the jury (m37 card) would
judge the Victim of Pedophilia when he was 10 years old,
the would help to hide the illegal human experiments ...
