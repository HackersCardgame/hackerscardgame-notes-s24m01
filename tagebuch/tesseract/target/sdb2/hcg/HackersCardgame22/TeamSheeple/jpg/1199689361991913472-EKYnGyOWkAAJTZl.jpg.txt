If you have a depiession it is not uncommon that

1 . We think it would me
technically possible to induce a decrescion, for example with
the fear detection card (m57) and some sort of
"bioresonance" based on your BigData Entry and maybe LRU
card (m54). | found out that in my case i can "hack" my
depressions, if i don't try to fight against the induced
depression but if i try to extend the depression and listen to
some really really depressing music. Maybe those who wrote
the mainframe code for induced depression forgot to write
this code too. So i become aware, and the depression has
less influence on my psyche. The good thing is that i then
somehow get access to the BigData and can begin to
disassemble ile data. Nc K ) 1

unknown: or the "depression detection! says: â€œhe feels
enough PAIN now" don't need more BigData && LRU?
