Inventor: XXXXX Year: ~????
Often little-noticed archetype in society: young
employee, that has to give bad news to customer or
other stakeholders. The Secretary behind the
Windwos Computer apologizes verbally, non-verbally
she enjoys her power (maybe her father was much
to "imperative"?). Further the regulated income
makes her as ignorant as a cocaine consumer. Lets
pray a risky shift. (Income = Maslow SafetyNeeds
fulfilled > "self-esteem" = dopamine release = feels
Superior = ignorance). One of the relevant scenes,
why Robert De Niro then runs amok, running amok is
a strong image that overwrites this scenes that has
led to the amok, but maybe not in the subconscious
of the participants, dtl card, but the amok was
maybe induced by t27 card
