O1 O02 V O3 O04

The old generation seems to have some sort of Algorithm that
calculates the maximal profit of an action they force to do a
Victim. For Example if the Victim (V) would make a graphiti to
tag an offender as Rapist or Murderer they would make let him
do that, but they would record that scene, then Judge (O01)
would start a criminal case, making profit with the law system,
The owner of the building (02) would get money for damage
the victim (V) did, the painter (O03) that redraws the wall in
white would get money for that Job... An additional "feature" of
such an algorithm would be that in the end the Victim would
be sentenced, shown in media as criminal, nobody would
beleive him and nobody would talk about the equal aged kid
that was raped or murdered, so the real rapist (O04) from the
old generation and the person that has access to this algoritm
(PsyOP) would be the main problem. unknwon: Weekens and
discredits the Victim that knows about the rape or the
murderer, intentionally?
