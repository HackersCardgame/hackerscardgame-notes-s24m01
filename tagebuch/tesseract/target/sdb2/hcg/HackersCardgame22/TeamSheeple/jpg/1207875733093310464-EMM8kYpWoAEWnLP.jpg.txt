IMHO the criminals use Violence, Posion, Acid and
such things to distract people like me that asks "to
many" relevant questions with psychological Warfare,
if iam confronted with a burned face they inject a lot
of missinformation(s) that is used later to steer me
into a false direction. It makes also paranoid,
depressed (maybe m94 card) and causes me on
concentrating less. | guess they did this also with the
people that asked questions if i would be the bad
guy, and that led to their believe that i would be the
criminal, since they question me and are "therefor"
beeing attacked, it would completely make sense to
belive that i am the offender and the criminal. But
just saying "burned face" = innocent would also be
wrong, see al4 card.
