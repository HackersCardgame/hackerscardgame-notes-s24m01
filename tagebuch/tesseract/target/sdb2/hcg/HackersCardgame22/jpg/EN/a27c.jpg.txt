As soon they have your TODO list they start
to write psychological warfare  socio-
psychology design patterns for that specific
todo. Lock this item on my TODO's list until
this malware is finished and they use it as
"additional selector" which seems to be more
some sort of booby-trap to hunt down
innocent people that are brave enogh to
speak out against satan.
