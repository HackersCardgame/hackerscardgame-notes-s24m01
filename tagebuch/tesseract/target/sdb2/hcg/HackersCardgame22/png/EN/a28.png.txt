Today there is software that recognizes what one
currently is doing. Input data does not need to be
video, it could also be audio, postitional data (maybe
one could do this even with a c64) or DBS, Neuralink,
Stimoceiver Data.
If they have things like m98 / m99 Cards they put
anoying eventtriggers on everything. | really hate
that since it wastes my time
