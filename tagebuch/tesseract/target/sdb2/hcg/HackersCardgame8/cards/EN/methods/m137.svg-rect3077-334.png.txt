The PsyOPs seem to work in different Groups, one
group tries to manipulate the Whistleblower or
Whitehat, the other group seems to manipulate the
family of the Whistleblower. They have touring
complete avatars of all people you know, so it's quite
hard to find out what is true communication(s) and
what is simulation. Separation from his socail systme
makes it more difficult. One move of my Shrink was
to tell me to catch up on my past, and my father he
told not to catch up with his past. So he can inject the
word "catch up" to generate an antagonizing
situation (m50). | guess technically there would be
some_ interface between such two world-views,
maybe some sort of crash detection that wants to
crash people intentionally. further research required.
