IMHO, cars are Skinner-BOXes too. A lot of electronic
Equipment in a car. People that uses a Car are beeing
programmed while driving, this is suboptimal anyway. So
we need to declare all Car Drivers to MKULTRA Killers as
long one can not proove that he is not. Urs B. knew about
that, he said in 2002: "All Cars with Antennas are remote
controlled" This would mean since he kept this secret he is
partitially responsable for all People died in Car Accidents.
He used this knowedge to show-off "his greateness" to his
daugther but not to save the victims. MKULTRAs would
get some benefit for driving a car, some sort of m15
Card. So the Term "Car Hacking" is also an overloaded
Symbol. Technically it would be some interface the user that
uses the MKULTRA would not know, tl... Card and eg some

where the MKULTRA Bot would get the
Stimulus: Go to place 23.
