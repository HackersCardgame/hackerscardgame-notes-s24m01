Overloading is possible in some _ programming
languages. | use this as meatphor for one could also do
with such a feature.

For example the above "WHY?" could mean:

| agree, i question everything even this "Question
Everything"

But you it could also mean:

Why sould i care and question things, i want to become
or stay an old fat hairy ugly ingorant pedophile person

in programming for example the calling function would
decide what "stream" on gets over an technology card,
in real world you could implement that with RFID,
HandylD, face recognition....
