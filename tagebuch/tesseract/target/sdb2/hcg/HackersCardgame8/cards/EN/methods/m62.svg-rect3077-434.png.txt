They seem to play this card only if one have hardly no
money or spent last money to red cross for water in syria.
One buys food with last money, and then they activate a
old ugly Bot (m48 Card) that eg. touches food, on t1...
they say that a suicide death bot was transferd to your
last food. The bad thing is, if you then would eat this food
this m44 would be activated. The only

. | guess this is
how they trigger poor people or homelessÂ® people. The
victim of this cyber-attack would then maybe attack the
person that transfered that malware (m50 Card). Often
this sort of Malware spreads to your whole existence and
to many of the scenes and objects you own. | heard they
use same sort of malware eg. on womans underpants.
We

but uneducated person would run amok.
