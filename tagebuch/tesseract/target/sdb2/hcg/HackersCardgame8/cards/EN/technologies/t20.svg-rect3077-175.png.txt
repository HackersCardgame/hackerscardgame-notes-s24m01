Generates a sweep and then the echo of this sweep
is evaluated to evaluate the whole system. More
modern devices are beeing used in eg. docsis
networks.

If you project this principle on wires/antennas that
that have been placed below the skin and eg. a
webcam as return channel you could maybe even
portscan humans or hijack their telemetry

Today we expect that digital technologies are used,
but the old things maybe still up and running
