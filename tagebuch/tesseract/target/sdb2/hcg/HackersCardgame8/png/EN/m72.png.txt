Normally CISSP books explain, that there are Mandatory
and Discretionary Access Control Systems. Unfortunately
the Person that implemented it for tl card decided to give
older People always more access rights than younger
people. Older people can access the younger people
even if they are naked or otherwise vulnerable, so
the CIA creates Acceptance for the _ Global
Surveillance Nightmare. This leads to (cyber-)rape,
makes older people using younger boys as weapons and
don't care about if they die, or would run amok during the
"mission". Exactly those things led me to do things like m32
or m44 (but so she nows im still ture), If you look below the
image in this or m32 card (.svg) then you would see, that
there are some victims that are much more affected than i.
The Access System should based on moral && intelligence,
since a morraly intact intelligent person would not risk lives
just to watch naked kids. See also m71 Card.
