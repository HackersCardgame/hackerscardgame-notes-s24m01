Inventor:

Maybe "in the far future" we could be hypnotized by a QR-
CODE since the Neuralink would dissociate one by a specivic
QR-code. Calling one insane or schizophrenic would maybe help
to hide what they have done to him. On the back of the ccd
Sensor you could even have a small LCD for triggering things.
(Stimulus-Response-Habits). So if unshure about that, CLOSE
EYES WHEN TYPING PASSWORDS. Even if a medic does
such things in hospital and sterile environment,

Workaround for hacked RetinaCCD would be to jam the
frequencies used by the RetinaCCD.

Alinag AG would therefor be
the scapegoats that distracts from this card, and that eg.

More relevatn they use Photogrammetry to create m89.
