Inventor:
Fill-guns are sold as a Ring on a chain, for example in
Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings". In fact would be a

to on fill-
gun. (Hopefully one has implemented an enhanced delete
function) If you put fill-gun into a (SE235,
or t25 / t26?) with the Cryptological
Keys are loaded and radio would join to Military Network.
Frequency hopping would allow to tranmit to
(e4) in the body. Main question would be, if the fill-
gun loads a radio, where are the fill-gun loaded.
Afaik Urs B. told me once that the Zurich Insuranse has
two specially secured terminals. Male Lobsters (bio1)
thend to show off with to compensate
their low self-esteem, in Biére an officier also showed off
his Fill-Gun . | / We guess that the Fill-Guns gives
the owner access to all owned soldiers.
