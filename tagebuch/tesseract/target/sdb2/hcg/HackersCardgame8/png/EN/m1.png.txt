Inventor: Hermann Rorschach Year: ~1900
Sold as a "phantasy test with formless blobs for
children, normal adults and for mentally ill", in fact it
distracts the questioned (fixation) so he not focuses
to much on the questions. A Hack would be to add
an eg. RFID or LC circuit on the backside of the
paper and to activate small Active Denial Systems or
Hum Noises or treble Sounds arround 15'000Hz
below the conscious perception threshold to let the
questioned act as a liar since his face would show
stress because of the active denial system that was
activated. Using an inkbolt test als "Lie detector"
would therefor fail in some cases.
