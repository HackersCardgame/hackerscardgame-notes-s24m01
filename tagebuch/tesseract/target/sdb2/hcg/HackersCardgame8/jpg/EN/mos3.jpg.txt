Mental Operating System would be a almost coherent dogma
room for lazy people. Those who create those systems try to
make as less mistakes as possible, so that the members don't
have to much cognitive dissonances otherwise they would start
to think by their own. But the creator adds backdoors and
triggers to the dogma room, so he can control and trigger its
members. There are antagonizing dogma rooms, eg. the Nazi
the Jewish Science Mental Operating System, they would
maybe be incampatible (m50 card). In my opinion the Jewish
Science MOS has less bugs, but people with low intelligence
would have less ambiguity tolerance. To show the Nazis where
they have bu igs could help to ee the situation.

Sass Y d uninsta a complete MOS

If you 1 find a aunges Nazi that is on the wrong way ; but
has not yet killed it wouldn't be ok to put him into jail, the only
morally intact thing would be to help him / her that (s)he does
not makes to much stupid things. | guess Nazis are victims of
parental abuse to install mos3 to use them as a Human-BOT.
