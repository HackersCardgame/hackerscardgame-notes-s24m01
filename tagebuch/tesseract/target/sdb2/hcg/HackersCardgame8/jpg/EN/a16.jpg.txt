If a person can be controlled or at least influenced by some
technology cards t* evil people unfortunately could create
some sort of a suicide death bot, using things like m38 card
for priming to make innocent people to comit suicide
(attempts). We think that this is the major way eg. CIA kills
people that know to much and the reason news are
normally not telling the story from people that commited
suicide (maybe they killed lan Murdock with a suicide death
bot). People with lower rank would be told that it's just
training or BDSM. But in fact if the Whistleblower would die
the whole group would be lost too and so controllable by
eg. the CIA, wirst case m37 && dtl card. Those groups that
already have "trained" a kid to death would never confess.
Forced to keep silent. Possibly the code of such suicide
death bots would be packed into proprietary non-
deterministic crypto both personalized or generic, eg. m38
would be generic. Was Jan Murdoch*@Debian also a victim?
