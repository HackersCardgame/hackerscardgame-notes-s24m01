If we use sheep as a metaphor for kids or people, satan
tries to separate one speep from the herd, as a hostage
to blackmalis the other sheeps (ma4) or if this does not
work they use the next dirthy trick and say the "black"
sheep is eg. a "Rapist Terrorist" (m41 card), then they
would even kill the "black" sheep (m46), eat it's goods
and then blackmail the other sheeps with the dtl card,
telling them that it's their fault bacause they helped
separate the victim. If they can make the other sheeps
agree in judging the "black" sheep with m37 card the
group would feel guilty (even when they not killed it) so
they normally would declare a new "black" sheep that
told the other to separate the a and the sd
