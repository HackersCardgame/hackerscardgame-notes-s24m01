E.g. the distribution of intelligence in society is
normal-distributed. If you would find out that people
that run amok or suicide quite often after they have
been "therapied" by mental institutions and then
they are shut away maybe in the same mental
institution after they run amok more than the
normal-distribution would predict, then you maybe
sould really ask some questions. Personal Traits (eg.
Mayer-Briggs) are noraml-distributed too. So these
formulas are quite useful to find out if one tells the
truth or not. But it is not evidence, but maybe
something one should investigate.
