If you would add a device to a webcam that can cause lot
of PAIN, for example with sound above 120dB or with an
implant or an Active Denial System that causes all
nociceptors to fire at the same time? Maybe one would
not see the cam after a while. This would be some sort of
Skinner Box or classical condtioning (t2, t11) and maybe
cards t10, t14, t15, t32, t33, m38, m26, endol, el, e2,
e3, e4, Involved. The cam would become invisible for the
poor mouse. Even specific images shown on computer. So
this would maybe the real reason why Pinky & Brain
never wins. If you feel PAIN since 17 years one could
begin to ignore that there are invisible things. But in my
case (i guess i'm a bit Autistic) this would be an invitation
to hack this of technology. And since | would be the
mouse it would be a selfe-experiment and therefor to try
to hack that would be a legitime move. Not prooven YET.
