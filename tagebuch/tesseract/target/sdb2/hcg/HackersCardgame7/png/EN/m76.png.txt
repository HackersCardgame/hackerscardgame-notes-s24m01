Stimulus-Response-Habits. Today it is "possibly"
implemented in software. The sort of Deprivation or the
Stimulus would maybe change’ randomly. The
communication channel (tl, t... cards) are maybe
randomized to, like SE-235 frequency hopping.

example 17 years torture or "white" torture after an initial
m38 card would be important too.
