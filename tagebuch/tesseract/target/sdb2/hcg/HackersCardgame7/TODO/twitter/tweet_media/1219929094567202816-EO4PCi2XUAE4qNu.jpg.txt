Buckle emulates the sound of an old 16M Hodel-M space saver bucklespring keyboard

It runs as a background process and plays back the sound of each key pressed and
released on the keyboard, just as if using an IM Model-H. The sound of each key
has carefully been sampled, and is played back while simulating the proper

distance and direction for a realistic 30 sound palette of pure nostalgic bliss.
