Fill-guns are sold as a Ring on a chain, for example in
Tolkien's "Lord of the Rings". In fact would be a black box

1 n to on fill-
gun. (Hopefully one has implemented an enhanced delete
function) If you put fill-gun into a | ) (SE235; of t2577/,
t26?) with h ing the Cryptological Keys are
loaded and radio would join to Military Network.
Frequency hopping would allow to tranmit to go V
(e4) in the body. Main question would be, if the fill-
gun loads a radio, where are the fill-gun loaded.
Afaik Urs B. told me once that the Zurich Insuranse has
two specially secured terminals. Male Lobsters (biol)
thend to show off with to compensate
their low self-esteem, in Bi√©re an officier also showed off
his Fill-Gun . | / We guess that the Fill-Guns gives
the owner access to all owned soldiers.
