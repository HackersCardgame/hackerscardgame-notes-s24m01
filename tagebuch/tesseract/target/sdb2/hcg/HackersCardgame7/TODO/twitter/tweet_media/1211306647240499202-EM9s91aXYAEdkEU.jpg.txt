If a NSA/CIA would have access to all peoples data,
even the private diaries they would maybe install
some Al that analyzes what the whitehat hacker just
says, writes or thinks

Then they would try to match that on persons in his /
her network that would get a cogntivie dissonace
because of that sentence or concept knowledge
even when i dont write names in my diary

CIA would possibly know what person or eg. Meyer-
Briggs archetypes would rage because of what i just
written into my privat diary. So it would be possible
that the CIA/NSA would intentianally send this
private diary entries to people to "motivate" them to
attack me.
