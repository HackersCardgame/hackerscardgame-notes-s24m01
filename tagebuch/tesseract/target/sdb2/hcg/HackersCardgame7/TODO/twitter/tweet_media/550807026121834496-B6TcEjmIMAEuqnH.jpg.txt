THE EXPERIMENT

‘A GROUP OF SCIENTISTS PLACED 5 MONKEYS IN A CAGE
AND IN THE MIDDLE, A LADDER WITH BANANAS ON TOP.

EVERY TIME A MONKEY WENT UP THE LADDER, THE
SCIENTISTS SOAKED THE REST OF THE MONKEYS WITH
COLD WATER.

‘AFTER A WHILE, EVERY TIME A MONKEY WENT UP THE
LADDER, THE OTHER ONES BEAT UP THE ONE ON THE
LADDER.

‘AFTER SOME TIME, NO MONKEY DARE TO GO UP THE
LADDER REGARDLESS OF THE TEMPTATION.

SCIENTISTS THEN DECIDED TO SUBSTITUTE ONE OF THE
MONKEYS, THE FIRST THING THIS NEW MONKEY DID WAS
‘TO GO UP THE LADDER. IMMEDIATELY THE OTHER MONKEYS,
BEAT HIM UP.

AFTER SEVERAL BEATINGS, THE NEW MEMBER LEARNED
NOT TO CLIMB THE LADDER EVEN THOUGH NEVER KNEW
WHY.

‘THE SECOND MONKEY WAS SUBSTITUTED AND THE SAME
OCCURED. THE FIRST MONKEY PARTICIPATED ON THE
BEATING FOR THE SECOND MONKEY. A THIRD MONKEY
WAS CHANGED AND THE SAME WAS REPEATED.
THE FOURTH WAS SUBSTITUTED AND THE BEATING WAS
REPEATED AND FINALLY THE FIFTH MONKEY WAS REPLACED.

WHAT WAS LEFT WAS A GROUP OF 5 MONKEYS THAT
EVEN THOUGH NEVER RECEIVED A COLD SHOWER,
CONTINUED TO BEAT UP ANY MONKEY WHO ATTEMPTED
TO CLIMB THE LADDER.

IF IT WAS POSSIBLE TO ASK THE MONKEYS WHY THEY
WOULD BEAT UPALL THOSE WHO ATTEMPTED TO GO UP
THE LADDER, | BET THEIR ANSWER WOULD BE:

“| DON’T KNOW. THATS HOW THINGS ARE DONE
‘AROUND HERE.’

DONT MISS THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THIS WITH

OTHERS AS THEY MIGHT BE ASKING THEMSELVES WHY

WE CONTINUE TO DO WHAT WE ARE DOING IF THERE
1S A DIFFERENT WAY OUT THERE,

Conclusion:

Don't follow others behavior, think
before you follow.

And

sorry for the long post, here's a
BANANA
