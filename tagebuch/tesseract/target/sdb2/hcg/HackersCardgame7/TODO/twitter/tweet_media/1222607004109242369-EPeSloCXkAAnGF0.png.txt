does, which is he’s an investigative journalist who works with top secret documents all the time with
extreme, extreme operational security to protect his sources. But when it came to computing,
J-school failed him. And as a result, he was compromised pretty badly. He was not using a
specialized operating system like Tails, which if you're a journalist and you're not using Tails [EI

Tails unl 1 really kn a Ii). Apple did a pretty good job
of revoking this application, and it was, you know, in theory it stopped, but there are lots of samples
from the same group and this group that did this is tied to a whole bunch of other attacks across the
world, actually, which is why it’s connected up there with Operation Hangover.

The scary thing, though, is that this summer, after we'd met, he was actually arrested relating to
some of these things. And now, as | understand it, he’s out, but, you know, when you mess with a
military dictatorship it messes with you back. So even though that's one of the lamest back doors,
his life is under threat. So just simple things can cause serious, serious harm to regular people that
are working for some kind of truth telling.
