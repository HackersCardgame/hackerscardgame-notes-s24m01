Role/Archetype Year: 1910
Frequent double archetype in US Movies: married
couple, who live a life in luxury financed with
robbery and murder, including massive drug abuse.
Often described as an "idyllic" partnership. These
roless or archetypes seem to be protected by the
CIA as the USA Gouvernment seems to use them as
startegic chessman / -combination in an occupation
country (imperialism). Abusing the "family is the
basic unit of our society ..." from the human
rights shameless and the children of the couple
often suffer and have to pay the bill later.
Beeing protected by a system as big as the CIA
means, that they will become ignorant after a
short while.
