One could create a touring complete avatar of the victim or
the scapegoat and every time when the jury or his social
system would of equal aged would listen to him and begin
to beleive that he is just the scapegoat, the victims /
scapegoats touring complete avatar would start to insult,
intimidate the jury or social group, so the victims allies
would stop listen to him or even begin to attack him, and
the real offender that is most likely 20 Years or more older
would then play dtl card to the group. This card seems to
extends the m37 card.

Technically it would be samples of earlier scenes when the
victim or scapegoat was tortured and he said things he
maybe just repeated (rawhammer attack of the mind, co2
card). This would give quite a lot of work to create such an
avatar, so it would be likely that the scapegoat is even a
pedophilia victim.
