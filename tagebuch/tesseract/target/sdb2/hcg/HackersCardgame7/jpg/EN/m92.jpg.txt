2019:
Shown as criminal or Rapist, signs of psychological Warfare

In my case they also did such things, for example the "anti
psychotics" also made me look ugly and made me behave
strange, so that the people stoped or even feared to talk
with me (m41) and they also told my friends that i would
have raped a girl, killed another friend, so they definitly tried
to kick me out of the group of my equal aged friends that
weakened me. But to be separated also helped me to stop
drinking alcohol. | was drinking alcohol with friends but never
alone. "Maybe" a bug in their plan. Beeing alone helped me
to reflect about me, my past, the scenes that lead to the
isolation, this cardgame helps to explain such situations.
