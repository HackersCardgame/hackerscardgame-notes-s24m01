If i don't have anti-psychotics, there is some
baseband load of things that makes me psychotic,
and about once a day the system makes me slap my
fists on the head, the reason why i bought a autism
helmet. With risperdal the base load is_ much
smaller. This seems to enable immediately after i
took the Risperdal (Eventtrigger on drug). This
makes me think that everything is ok. But though
there are Bursts of bad scenes, and this scene is
then looped for about 15 Minutes, but then gets
down-voted. In my opinion the lower base-load would
decrease my ability to cope with such things, since
i don't have that much training anymore as without
anti-psychotics. The bad scene is then deleted,
that is great for not beeing psychotic, but in this
world maybe a "good situational awareness" and
training would be better that the patient learns to
survive.
