Inventor: XXXXX Year: ~????
It seams that they can identify the thoughts or words
with the stimociver +70 years or the Neuralink. To get
the map or at least to get used to an idea of your map
of the content they use against you just think of
random things (people, objects, sex toys...) when they
enabled the automated psychological warfare. So the
system would transmitt the objects, vocals and
images linked to this specific keyword. Using paper
and pencil to draw the map, even pre-printed
templates or both simplifies this task.

So they still could enable it, but they would lose their
psychological warfare algorithms and of course
"nobody" would leakt them. So we maybe have some
sort of an Nash equilibrium.
