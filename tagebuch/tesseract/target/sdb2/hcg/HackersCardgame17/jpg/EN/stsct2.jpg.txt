AX.25 would be the simplest way for digital
communication over random frequencies. Expect
that they have tons of such technolgoies. Never play
Red Team, except you really really Know what you
are doing. Just listening to transmissions
possibly causes less harm then eg. "portscanning".
Worst case satan even (ab)uses the lives of innocent
kids as fence to protect its systems against hacking
attacks. If you would kill a kid by a portscan
then they own you because then you are a
murderer too!!!
