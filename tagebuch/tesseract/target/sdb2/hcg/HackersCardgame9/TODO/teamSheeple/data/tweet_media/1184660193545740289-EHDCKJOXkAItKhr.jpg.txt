People tend to subjugate other people and making
them "usable" for their own profit. Globally there are
many of such systems that use things like dtl card
to enslave people. Right-Wing people seem to thrive
in Military Systems. Maybe not even by their own
intention, maybe they have had dominant parents
and learned that they feel less pain if they just do
what the older person says. | myself was always
rebel and begun early to question things the older
generation said. This way | learnd that i must
deffend against the older generation and help the
younger that they obey their false order from Hitler.
And it would not be fair to be mean to the younger,
we need to find a way to free all younger people
from the slavery of the older generations.
