installation of
irrelevant information

Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~2?22?

IMHO there is a nightly (maybe global [generic|personalized])
algorithm on the Network / Mainframe, that installs irrelevant
or false information to your brain. Or it primes (Priming
[psychology]) you to buy crap you don't need. The next day
this installed information is recalled and makes you buy
spontaneous crap you don't need.
Prerequisites:
- (Global)
- A or a(t, b* Cards)
- (eg. pl, p7 card)
The Psyche of 1980s+ people normally survive withtout all
that junk like Car, House, Gorden traveling around globe...
