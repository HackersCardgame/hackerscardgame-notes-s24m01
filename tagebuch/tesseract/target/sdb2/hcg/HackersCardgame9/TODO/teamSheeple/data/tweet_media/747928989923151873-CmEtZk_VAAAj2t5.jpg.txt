Artist Statement
ltyouwere to see me out in some wild and remote setting in the middle of the night, you might think mm
some crazy guy waving a flashlight around, On further inspection, you might then just barely make out a
camera and a tripod in the dark, and then be totally convinced I'm nuts. Well, sort of. This is the realm of
night photography. The images | produce are long exposures, averaging 3 to 30 minutes each, and are
‘wholly hand-created at he time of exposure, between shutter open and shutter closed. | do not add
anything tothe images in post processing, and only use Photoshop for digital noise reduction,
contamination removal, and classical print manipulation like dodging and burning. While traditional
photography generally represents a frozen momentin time, capturing an existing image, my images are
created within the fluid period of long-exposure. Like some sort of twisted sci-fl episode, | manipulate
the world within a moment, notjust reacting as a viewer of any particular scene. | encourage movement,
painting of subjects with light, and the addition of various elements to the photo with whatever light tools
‘or props come to mind. As long as they lightup, or can be litup.| am drawn to the dynamic contrast of
scenes that comes with the intensity of lightin the dark. Some of my images literally glow back as it
powered byneon - those are my favorites - and they require exacting printing, paper, and inkto bring out
the “amperage”.

I've always been an outdoors person with a passion for landscape photography,

ok, danke fir die Info.

Anilere Frage: ht sich dieser Wurfel in Nevada oder Mojave nicht ein bisschen einsam oder soll er
einfach Warteljager in die Waste locken, damit die Jager moglichst fem von den anderen “Zucker:
Warfeli” bleiben?
