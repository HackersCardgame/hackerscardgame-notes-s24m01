My wannabe Hacker Name ist landev. If one would
lock at people as some sort of software or program
you can start on a shell, one could put himself or
others into debug mode (-d) and in verbose mode (-v)
and since i'm very verbose its maybe (-vvv). | do this
intentionally so that other people, especially younger
people understand what i think, and to correct or
learn from my behavior. Some people also say that

this is insane, but i guess in my case it is a feature

not a bug.
