Inventor Hermann Rorschach Year ~1900

Sold as a "phantasy test with formless blobs for
children, normal adults and for mentally ill", in
fact it distracts the questioned (fixation 1),
with a simple RFID or LC circuit stuck on the
backside of the paper it's also possible to activate
small Active Denial Systems, Hum Noises or treble
Sounds arround 15'000Hz below the conscious
perception threshold (fixation 2...)

As a "Lie detector" but mostly to distract from the
survey and the attempt to read out private
thoughts and emotions ...
