Inventor: Year: 95
If you would have something like Neuralink and
Windows tells you, click here and an innocent person
will die, or if you are using mouse Gestures it would
say "if you draw a V with your mouse" [dx/dt|dy/dt]
then a mandarin will die. Then you maybe would not
do this. But if Windows says, this should not be
possible and illegal, so you need to test that so that
no-one else goes into this trap, then you maybe
really killed someone. Since you don't know this
person and since Windows was sold as kids-toy and
not as Weapon you are maybe just the Scapegoat for
a kill someone else did. Maybe people killed Muslims
on Windows so the "Colateral Murder Video" would
revictimize 16Mio People for drawing this damn V on
Windows.
