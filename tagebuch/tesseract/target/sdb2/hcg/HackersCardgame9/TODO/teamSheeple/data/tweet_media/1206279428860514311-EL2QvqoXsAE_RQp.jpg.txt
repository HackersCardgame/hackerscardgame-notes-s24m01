Where the NSA pulls data out of your computer, irradiate stuff and then grab it, right? Everybody
who raised their hand and said they're not surprised, you already knew about TEMPEST, right?
Right? Okay. Well, what if | told you that the NSA had a specialized technology for beaming energy
into you and to the computer systems around you, would you believe that that was real or would
that be paranoid speculation of a crazy person?

[laughter]

Anybody? You cynical guys holding up your hand saying that you're not surprised by anything, raise
your hand if you would be unsurprised by that.

[laughter]

Good. And it’s not the same number. It’s significantly lower. It’s one person. Great.

Here's what they do with those types of things. That exists, by the way. When | told Julian Assange
about this, he said, “Hmm. | bet the people who were around Hugo Chavez are going to wonder
what caused his cancer.” And | said, “You know, | hadn't considered that. But you know, I haven't
found any data about human safety about these tools. Has the NSA performed tests where they
actually show that radiating people with 1 Ji[fwatt of RF energy at short range is safe?’

[laughter]

My God!

No, you guys think I’m joking, right? Well, yeah, here it is.
