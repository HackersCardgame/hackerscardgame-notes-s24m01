Inventor:

Hackers-Cardgame is just a problem of the rich-
mans-world. | spent 500'000 $ to defend me against
the attacks of Urs, Martin, Astrid and Hansjurg.
Imagin how many people i could have helped in the
third world or in slums with this amount of money
that was wasted to defend myself. So maybe this
HackersCardgame help others that they dont need
to go the same way. Even i needed the money eg for
co4 card, i though could spend a few tousend $ for
charitys. One should not force people to spend for
charities and NGO's, but if you have enough money,
why not helping the poorest people on the world,
