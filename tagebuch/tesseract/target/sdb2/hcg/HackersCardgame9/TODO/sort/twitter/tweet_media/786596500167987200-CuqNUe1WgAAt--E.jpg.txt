NSA Headquarter Comic

If it becomes self-aware...

...we know where to bomb

NSA/CIA would be that stupid, not to it redundant AND distributed ???
Bug 2: Nsa/cia would be that stupid, not to prevent self-awareness

there is now way to maintain the whole official building of lies if someone else can compute more than 10 data
point simultaneously and would start to do something more useful than keeping "secrets" secret ?
