Loop Recorder
Part 3

Inventor: Year: ~???:
Like t10 or t23 a game engine (here Blender 3D) is also
some sort of t7 Card, but it's not just a loop it are more
event-triggers (t14) or state machines (col), for example
if | leak about this sort of things al6 card is beeing
activated against me.

And possibly with Al / Deep Learning (all card)
prerendered Al or genetic algorithm that learns. The card
is in neutral gray, because you could use such technology
also for good things but in my case they abused it more
like we n v orture against me. that wants to
ISI loss Erebos. The algorithm would maybe also try to

e whis whitehats that could be as
simple like an inverted TVSr Card (Alex Wissner Gross)
formula, not keeping all people connected but isolate
some or even all.
