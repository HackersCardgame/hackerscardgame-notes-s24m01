my opinion it is more likely that in places where more people hear "the voices"
something causes more Schizophrenic diseases like Toxoplasma Gondii [1] and
people dont want admit that they are Schizophneics so they say it's some evil

The track is really nice...

but the emulation of voices sounds more like an Schizophrenic disease, while i
did not take my medicine i had the same thing, heard voices that sounded
exactly like people i knew. | was even thinking that i have a Brainchip what was
completely wrong
