@ CIA MAINFRAME

Inventor: Year:

. it installs all the nasty cards to the people in Switzerland
" " Agency. First it

, second it would maybe . It

seams that CIA begins to blow up his PsyOPs after one found
that (see mos* cards) It
would be likely, that the PsyOPs have contacts to the CIA
network. *CYBER Blitzkrieg* (we translate what the CIA would
like to say: it are the >>>Nazis<<< um the Germans and no, no
the cia does not actively obfuscates qFire, quantum inserts,
TURBINE and TARMOIL) But we guess that there are some soft of
batch jobs that owns systems globally, not only computers or
mainframes, but also routers, handies or the Swiss INTAF...

We need to find out what
divices can access Stimoceiver, Neuralink... Wirst case most
enduser devices have some sort of SDR devices that can access
t* cards. In this case we need to find out what devices, second
thing what we could do is preventing things like NROL-39
Kraken... third thing we can do is to teach people Psychology
