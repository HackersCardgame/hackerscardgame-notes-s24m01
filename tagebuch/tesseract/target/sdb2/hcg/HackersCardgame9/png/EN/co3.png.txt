Invent ~1997
Global Mailserver Survillance Software.

The public people was informed about Carnivore and
then "suddenly" all people forgot about that thing.
So maybe those things are deleted while you are
dreaming / sleeping (cards tl, t10, t12, m116,
m117...) as a global default process for all people .

If it would be a default process, one could maybe
find out, what they are trying to delete and focus
more on that things.
