seams ; that CIA begins to blow up his PsyOPs after one found
that (see mos* cards) |
would be likely, that the PsyOPs have contacts to the ai
network. *CYBER Blitzkrieg* (we translate what the CIA would
like to say: it are the >>>Nazis<<< um the Germans and no, no
the cia does not actively obfuscates qFire, quantum inserts,
TURBINE and TARMOIL) But we guess that there are some soft of
batch jobs that owns systems globally, not only cee ii
GTAIATCaMES, Be: also routers, handies or the Swiss INTAF...

enduser devices have some sort of SDR devices that can access
t* cards. In this case we need to find out what devices, second
