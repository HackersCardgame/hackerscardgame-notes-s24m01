Role/Achrchetype Year:
Guybrush Threepwood had the role of the hero

In the Lucas Arts game Monkey Island™

In classic tarot he would be "The Fool"-Card,
actually too stupid to save the world, but has
non-normal-distributed luck and his childish
behavior gives him high values in the dimension
“agreeableness" which would be perfect as a
chessman would of satan, admiting Guybrush is
stupid not telling that he can use him as
chessman... but he is not even stupid but very
young
