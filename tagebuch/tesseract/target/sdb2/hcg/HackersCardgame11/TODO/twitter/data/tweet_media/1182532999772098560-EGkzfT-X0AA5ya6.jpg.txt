Inventor:

Originally developed by Delgado, now possibly been
developed "in secrecy" since 60 Years, placed
directly in the brain, and with software like OpenBCl
and maybe Deep Learnign algorithms possibly
recognizes even detaild thougths. No matter how
good the encryption would be, if wires are mede out
of metallic wires such devices would all be
vulnerable to side channel attacks [fc = A / 2] if
geometry if the wires are know and there is a device
with enough power nearby.

| tweeted to Elon Musk asking what he is going to do
about this vulnerability in Neuralink, but he did not
answer so far. Maybe Neuralink is just a honeypot for
older technologies, and maybe Hashtags are filtered
