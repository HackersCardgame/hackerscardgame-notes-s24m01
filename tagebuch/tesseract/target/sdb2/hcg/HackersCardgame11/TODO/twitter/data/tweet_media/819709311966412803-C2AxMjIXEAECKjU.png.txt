crazy tin foil hat

Inventor Year
Since the Roswell-Incident, the CIA started to
cover illegal Human Experiments with Aliens and
UFO Landings. Those who found out tried to find a
way to protect. Because thin foil would possibly
block the Stimoceiver Implants, they had to
discredit this archetype in Media as a Crazy
Person. Here for Example without tin foil:
Henry Starling in Star Trek Voyager S3E8

Use Cases

To gloss over illegal Human Experiments that went
wrong (premeditation), and because anesthesia
went wrong much more these days
