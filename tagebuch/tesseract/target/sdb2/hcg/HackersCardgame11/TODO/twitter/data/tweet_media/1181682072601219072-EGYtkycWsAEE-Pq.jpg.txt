EEG was originally developed by neurologist Hans
Berger. The Brain Computer Interface is an EEG
that recognizes patterns of brain currents with
software (pattern recognition) and then can
activate events e.g. to start the loT-Toaster. Today
with more computing power, there are much more
possibilities than in 1929.
