‘ Dont stand near the metal detector any longer than is necessary,

‘Dont lean against the structure ofthe system.

« Ifscanning with a handheld metal detector is necessary, tell the security personnel that
you have an ICD or pacemaker, and request an alternative form of inspection, such as a
pat down. Ifthey insist on using a handheld metal detector, ask them not to hold the
wand near your device any longer than is absolutely necessary

See the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) advisory page for those traveling with

implanted devices.

Cell phones

Wireless transmissions from the antennae of phones available n the United States are a very
small isk to ICDs and even less of arisk for pacemakers,

«+ Technology's rapidly changing as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
makes new wireless frequencies available.

‘= Newer celiphones using these new frequencies might make ICDs and pacemakers less
reliable. The wireless industry is investigating that possibilty.

«+ Keep walkie-talkies (operating on three watts or less) atleast six inches away from your
ICD or pacemaker implantation site.
+ Bluetooth® headsets don't appear to interfere with ICDs or pacemakers.

MP3 players/headphones

MP3 players, such as an iPods, don't pose a risk to ICDs or pacemakers. However, the
headphones used with MPS players can interfere with both devices, Most MP3 headphones
‘contain a magnetic material that can interfere with ICDs and pacemakers. Both earbud and
clip-on headphones can cause interference, So, bear in mind:

+ Keep headphones at least six inches away from your ICD or pacemaker.
+ Dont allow someone wearing headphones to rest his or her head on your chest.
+ Dont place headphones in your breast pocket.

+ Dontt drape headphones around your neck so that they hang on your chest.
