Inventor: xxxx Year: ~????
On my computer when i was trying to do things, to fix
things, to finish business. There are some problems like
extending pam-usb to udisk2 where unknown starts an
algorithm that pervents me from solving the problem. The
algorithm starts tons of new problems that are relevant too,
| begin to solve them all but always when i solved one 80%
of the tasks, the next problem opens or even they start aa
suicide death bot against me, That this problems are finally
beeing solved. There are some sort of "resonators" like in
Ingress, that prevent the whitehat hacker / whistleblower
from solving it. Resonators are maybe just other people that
are beeing activated to extend the problem. If these are
additional people they are maybe beeing activated with
data from the NSA / CIA DataRetention System that would
prove earlier sins of the "BOTs", Mathematically spoken
maybe partitially transitive. tl "this is not solvable,
hahaha" (that is just psychological warfare)
