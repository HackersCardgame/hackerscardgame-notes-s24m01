Equation Group malware or even Built-In i
customized firmware for Harddrives
SolidStateDrives. They publicly said that it is "just"
some malware to reinfect your computer. In my
humble opionion it has also some remote interface
like the eyefi SD Card has, technicall some sort of
AX.25 interface but way more modern. And one of
those things the seed to the public and those people
that ask questions, tweet to the Hashtag
#EquationGroup would end up the 10th time in a
Mental Institution. (see m138 Card) Further
research required...
