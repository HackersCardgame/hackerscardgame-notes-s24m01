Microdot

For other uses, see Microdot (disambiguation.

[Amilcrodot is text or an image substantially reduced in size to prevent detection by unintended recipients. Microdots are normally circular and around one milimetre in diameter butcan be made into
diferent shapes and sizes and made fom various materials such as polyester or metal. The name comes from the fact that the microdots have often been about the size and shape of a typographical
dot, such as a period or the tite of lowercase jor. Microdots are, fundamentally, a steganographic approach to message protection.

In 1870 during the Franco-Prussian War, Paris was under siege and messages were sent by carrer pigeon. Parisian photographer René Dagron used a photographic shrinking technique to permit each
pigeon to carry a high volume of messages, as pigeons have a restricted payload capacity

Improvementin technology since then has made even more miniaturization possible" At the International Congress of Photography in Paris in 2925 Emanuel Golaberg presented a method of producing extreme reduction microdots
using a two-stage process. First, an inital reduced negative was made, then the image of the negative was projected from the eyepiece ofa madiied microscope onto a collodlum emulsion where the microscope specimen slide would be.
‘Te reduction was such that a page of text would be legibly reproduced in a surface of 0.01 sq, mm. This density is comparable tothe entire text ofthe Bible fifty times over in one square inch. Goldberg's “Mikrat(microdot) was
prominently eported atthe time in English, French and German publications 1")

[A technique comparable to modern microdots fr steganographic purposes was fist used in Germany between World War | and World War I, was also later Used by many counties to pass messages through insecure postal channels.
Later microdot techniques used film wit aniline dye, rather than sver halide layers, a5 ths was even harder for counteresplonage agents to fin.

‘popular article on espionage by). Edgar Hoover in the Reader's Digest in 1946 atributed invention of microdots to “the famous rofestor Zapp atthe Technical Unversity Dresden’ 8] However, there never was a Professor Zapp at that
‘university and microdet historian Wiliam White has denounced Hoover's article asa concoction of semitruths and overt disinformation”.

Nevertheles, this article was reprinted, translated, and widely and uncritically cited inthe iterature on espionage. Hoover's Zapp has been wrongly identified with Walter Zapp Inventor ofthe Minox camera which was used by spes but did
not make microdets. Hoover appears to have conflated Emanuel Goldberg, who wasa professor in Dresden, with Kurt Zapp who, lat in the Second World War, wasn Dresden and taught spies how to make microdots "1A World Wari spy
etfor microdot production was sometimes called a Zapp out.

tn Germany after the Berlin Wall was erected, special cameras were used to generate microdots which were then attached to letters and sent through the regular mail. These microdots often went
"unnoticed by inspectors, and information could be read by the intended recipient using a microscope,

sh mail censors sometimes referred to microdots as “dt since they were distributed here and thee throughout letters rather like ralsins inthe British teamed suet pudding called “plum dut™
