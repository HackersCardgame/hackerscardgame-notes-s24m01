Old Patients
makes joung patient
(more) Psychotic

psychiatry nurses

Treat the patient with
intelligence-reducing
psychotropic drugs

Inventor: Satan Year: ~2??2?

Situation in H7.2 Mental Institution
KÃ©nigsfelden. There are a "few" older
patients that tries to make the young
oe more psychotic to make it look more
egitimate to give them AntiPsychotics. There
seems to be one Master Pedo-Patient that
commands the other pedo-"Patients". They also
influence the the psychiatry nurses
maliciously (making the nurses angry on the
young patient, b1&&t1 Card?) that normally
ends up that the jung patient is beeing
forced to take intellicence-reducing drugs.

Just in case im Right with this card, it
would be important to find all the young
patients that got victim of such a
"sondersetting" (german) and help them with
equalaged good people.
