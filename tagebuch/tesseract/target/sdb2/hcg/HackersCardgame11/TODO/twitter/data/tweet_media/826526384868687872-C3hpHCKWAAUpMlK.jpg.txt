Role / Archetype

The role of the judge is one of the most powerful
in the system, in many movies shown as a fat
"cute" Santa Claus. The role would be perfect for
a mastermind of a terror-network to hide in such a
role that is hardly ever shown as the evil killer
in TV. In computer science one would speak of a
single point of failure, so it would also be
perfect for a foreign aggressor, secret service to
subdue the whole system. In "To protect and infect
part 2" (12:17) @ioerror says "Is not clear to me,
that a Judge would understand anything I just
said" -- but an evil mastermind would maybe avoid
to hold an office and influence the system in
"secrecy"
