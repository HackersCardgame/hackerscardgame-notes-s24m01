J-school failed him. And as a result, he was compromised pretty badly. He was not using a
specialized operating system like Tails, which if you're a journalist and you're not using Tails you
should probably be using Tails unless you really know what you're doing. Apple did a pretty good job
of revoking this application, and it was, you know, in theory it stopped, but there are lots of samples
from the same group and this group that did this is tied to a whole bunch of other attacks across the
world, actually, which is why it’s connected up there with Operation Hangover.

The scary thing, though, is that this summer, after we'd met, he was actually arrested relating to

some of these things. And now, as | understand it, he’s out, but, you know, (aeaN eI"

So even though that’s one of the lamest back doors,
is life is under threat. So just simple things can cause serious, serious harm to regular people that

are working for some kind of truth telling.

And that to me is really a big part of my motivation for coming here to talk about what I'm going to
talk about next, which is that for every person that we learn about like Rafael, | think there are lots
of people we will never learn about, and that’s, to me that's very scary, and | think we need to bring
some transparency, and that’s what we're going to talk about now.
