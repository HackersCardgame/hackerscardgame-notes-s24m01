EEG data transmits signals to brain. Can activeate certain
functions in brain, wires in the Amygdala would probably cause
agressions (b1 card). Active community (read only, and non-
invasive) on Twitter: @OpenBCl. Even things like directly "built-in"
Augmented Reality (Like PokemonGO) could be achieved with
such technologies. There are maybe other ways
W0O2005055579A1, US4877027... ( ). Maybe sold as lie
detector (co2,m57,m77,m125...) reads thoughts & emotions,
influences emotions, automate/abuse victims, CryEngine / Unity
(m98,m99,t32,m60...)

for the group m46 first as shown as m41 over t1 then
m37 -> m46 -> dt1 so people could not integrate the existence of
things like Stimoceiver in their world view, Matthaeus::7::1

video not mentioning implants, i question that, Youtube CIA Honeypot?
