Don't blame Kid1 nor Kid2 nor Parent
my opinion its a fe ee ee

Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~????
1. Kid 1 is bored (therefore doing things random things to stop
the boredom)

2. Parent 1 spends time with Kid 1

3. Kid 1 stops with random things and is lucky that Parent 1
plays with him / her.

4. Kid 2 thinks it would be existentially to be part of this group
(Kid 1 & Parent 1) too

5. Parent 1 plays with Kid 2 too

6. Kid1 now thinks that it is a thread to his existence

(7. maybe therefore Kid1 is begin to be evil to Kid2)

8. Parent 1 tries to make them play with each other or as a
group of three

9. technology (t* card) makes Kid1 focus on Objects (m2 card)
and so the problem stays unsolved

10a. Kid1 & Kid2 dont learn to 8. -> goto 1

10b. Aditionally the parent(s) would be scapegoats for this
possibly technological induced problem, eg. b1 && tl Card.

11. by the age of 20+ one would play cards mos2=m37=dt1??
