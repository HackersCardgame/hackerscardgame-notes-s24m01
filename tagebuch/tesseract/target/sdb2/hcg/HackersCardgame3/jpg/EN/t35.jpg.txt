malliframes, but ls RELIES, py Inetnelick or the Swiss INTAF...

n es? K os? We need to find out what
diviees can access Stlmocelver Neuralink... Wirst case most
enduser devices have some sort of SDR devices that can access
t* cards. In this case we need to find out what devices, second

Kraken... third thing we can do is to teach people Psychology
