| guess a lot people knew that the twin towers will fall. In my
opinion very likely that the people from CIA knew. If you look
at m95 the "war on terror" would have obfuscated perfectly
that the CIA begun to undemine onieeend since 1932 or
even since 1968. This two Rastal ART\

glasses i got from Werner Erenenn @ â€œABB Fledbls
Automation AG, ZH Altstetten in the year 2000. When he
gave them to me as a gift he said something like: "This
Glasses will be precious in the near future". With just a bit of
imagination one could the two glasses that were in a nice
blue cardboard as the twin-towers with the holes from the
airplanes. When i Asked Urs / Astrid Blum (there was a time
when i trusted them) in 2002 what they think about my
theory. They said "no, no of course nobody knew about that
the twin-towers will fall". What they said seemed to me like a
very very cheap lie. As soon as one begun to question the
official version people begun to discredit or even attack.
