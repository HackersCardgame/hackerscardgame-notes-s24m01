The observer pattern (also called listener pattern) is
a design pattern in software development. It belongs
to the category of behavior patterns.

Some people would like that the non techie people
think that "observer pattern" means that all the IT
and Computer Science People are doing _ illegal
Surveillance and even work for the NSA / CIA. But in
fact the term Observer Pattern has nothing to do
with surveillance. But of course this design pattern
could also be abused in illegal surveillance. (The
strange thing is that this colored part was deleted in
my repo) So another way to isolate gifted computer
science people from the people gifted in other
things.
