If you have a production line (that can be abused to
programm stimulus-reaction-habits), the line can
have several different states, so you have to define
the states and how / when (eg. eventtrigger) they
change, see eg. Siemens S7 PCL

The same principle is unfortunately also abused
aganist humans or even children:

1. Normal: loop { you will be raped } =>

2. : someone says "Fu** your Mother" =>

3. Rage

Induced with eg t1 or t* card
