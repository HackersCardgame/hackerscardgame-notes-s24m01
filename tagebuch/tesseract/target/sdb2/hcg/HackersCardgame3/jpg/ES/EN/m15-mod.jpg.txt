A) Limbic System Vulnerability

Pl

Inventor

Since we are genetically still over 90% identical to our
ancestors that were driven by the limbic system
(Neandertals, Monkeys, RUSTâ„¢-Bots) our brain is
vulnerable eg. to fat food, sex, slides. This is used by
advertising industry, but also "used" for imposing
your will on others.

Michael Foucault: "Human body and the human
disposition in terms of the priority of sexual
desire" (Euphemism)

Use Cases

A Sociopath does not care about the sexual integrity of
others, his primary focus is to sell crap and he would also
abuse the SCC BDSM card and ignore resulting consequences
