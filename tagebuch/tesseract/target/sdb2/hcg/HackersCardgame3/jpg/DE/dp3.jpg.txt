Design patterns are proven solution templates
for recurring design problems in architecture
as well as in software development.

A design pattern usually contains several
classes (templates), so a single design
pattern is a collection of different
templates. E.g. The shape of a single step of
stairs AND the railing (steelwork or eg
woodwork) for the complete stairs AND for
example the shape for the carpet of each step
