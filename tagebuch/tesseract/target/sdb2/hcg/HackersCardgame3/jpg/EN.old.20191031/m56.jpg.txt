Often the offenders try to intimidate the victim(s). There
are may ways they do that, with weapons (m21) with law
(co4) with threads against the people i love, with poison
(eventtrigger on eg. the drink you just had and a loop:
"You've just been poisoned, hahaha"), or they tell you "we
will put you again in a mental institution where they force
you to take drugs that even kill, eg Zyprexa. Often they
additionally use the role toggler card (m42) and tell the
victim, that he is intimidating the offenders to keep the
victim confused. It is normal that they activate several
systems, eg. mental institutions, law system, people that
hacks the victims computer... it's psychological warfare
but i am careful because i know they killed Tobias Moser
(m46 card) those who think i would like to blame pirate
party, because of skull, in C++ there is something like
, one could do this with symbols too
