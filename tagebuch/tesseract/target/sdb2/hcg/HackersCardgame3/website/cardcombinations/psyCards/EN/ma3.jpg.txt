Secretary (The FAN)

The Big Five

Often Little-noticed archetype in society: Young
employee, that has to pass bad news(Backof fice?)
to customer or other stakeholders. The Secretary
behind the Windwos Computer apologizes verbally,
non-verbally she enjoys her power (maybe her
father much to "â€œimperative"?). Further the
regulated income makes her as ignorant as a
cocaine consumer. (Income = Maslow::SafetyNeeds
fulfilled = "self-esteem" = dopamine release =
feels superior = ignorance). Relevant scenes, why
Robert De Niro runs amok, running amok is a strong
image that overwrites other scenes that have led
the amok, but not in the subconscious of the
participants: sin = compulsion = crime
