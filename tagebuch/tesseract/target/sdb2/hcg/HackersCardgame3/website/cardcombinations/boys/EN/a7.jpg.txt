Design patterns are proven solution templates
for recurring design problems in architecture
as well as in software development.

A design pattern usually contains several
classes (templates), so a single design
pattern is a collection of different
templates. E.g. The shape of a single step of
stairs AND the railing (steelwork or eg
woodwork) for the complete stairs AND for
example the shape for the carpet of each step

Use Cases
Architecture, Software development, psychology
(Archetypes), Sociology (Archetype-Combinations)
