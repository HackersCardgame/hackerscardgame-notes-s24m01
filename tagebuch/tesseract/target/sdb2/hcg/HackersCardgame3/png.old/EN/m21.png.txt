(A) TraumaBased Mind Control

Inventor Year

They burn a trauma into the victim's psyche, in
order to be able to reactivate the trauma
(reVictimizing @ Power > Power abuse). In
Rombachtali 11/13 there are so far 7 killings by
one of the owners, so he ordered someone else to
make a bullet hole to distract from the relevant
scenes that would bring the assassin into jail. Step
two seems to be, that the Killer bought the Judge.

Use Cases

If someone would find the "surveillance" Infrastructure,
and could proof that this surveillance does not just
listen, the owner could not deny his complicity
anymore. reVictimizing with simple gun shot sound
