Computers are highly complex, nobody understands really what
a CPU does in detail. Also Operatingsystems are complex, if you
would take an average Operating System you would have at
least 5GB. 1GB would be 500'000 A4 Pages that would weigh
2500kg. so if you would multiply that with 5 one would easily
find out that nobody could handle that. Therefor the companies
invented "The IT Supoorter", in the early days they got a lot
money, today not anymore. So if something goes wrong or even
someone dies because of the companies computernetwork the
20 years old IT-Guy will be the Scapegoat and even sentenced. If
you add the complete content that is handled with a computer it
are more Exabytes than Gigabytes. So definitly nobody can
handle that. But of course the 20 Years old IT-Guy will be held
responsible, even if he is the one with the smallest salery like i
had in 1999 at ABB Flexible Automation, ZH Altstetten. And if
you would tell what happens at such soft of companies they
maybe even kill me. CIA/NSA would disable malware if the
supporter analyzes the problem to keep the malware secret.
