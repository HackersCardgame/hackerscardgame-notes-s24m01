Problem
(PsyOPs)

Inventor: Satan Year: ~????
There are some sort of Death Circles in many subcultures
(m37 Card). The circle can be out of individuals or out of
companies / Juristic Persons (Mainframes)

Some kids really think it would be good to kill the
whistleblower / whitehat hacker, because the parents show
them the fake image of him cyber-raping innocent women on
the "inner eye" (eyel, tl...) and enable an active denial
system (t15, bl, t1) against the kids but

, or to help him not to
become to powerful, "Scherbengericht"

Unfortunately the
PsyOPs kills 1 out of 80 and then dtl card is played against
the circle of kids and also against the parents circle to make
them do what Satan want them to do.
