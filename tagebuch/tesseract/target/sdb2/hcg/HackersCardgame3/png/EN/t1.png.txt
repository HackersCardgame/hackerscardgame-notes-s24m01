Inventor: José Manuel Rodriguz Delgado ~1950
The newest versions (see Neuralink, Elon Musk,

HoneyPot) read data (like EEG) and transmitting
signals to the brain. Can activeate certain functions
in the brain, wires in the Amygdala would probably
cause agressions (bl card). You can find an active
community (read only, and non-invasive) on Twitter:
@OpenBCl maybe they try patch satans work.
Things like directly "built-in" Augmented Reality (Like
PokemonGO) could be achieved too with such
technologies, see also Patent WO2005055579A1
(HoneyPot) or t12 Card. Can be used as lie detector
(co2 card), read thoughts & emotions, influence
emotions, automate & control victims (maybe with
3D GameEngine CryEngine / Unity, and possibly
Google Maps 3D, OpenStreetMap?)
