Inventor: xxxxx

As a kid | pirated lots of Software / Music / Movies. So
they blackmailed me with that until i relicensed
everything. As far as i know i relicensed "Monkey
Island 1" and/or Doom1 about three times.

After they could not blackmail me anymore with
piracy they begun to blackmail me with things that
go against my sexual integrity or they used scenes
like "you've just been poisoned" or "you've just been
raped under hypnosis"

after all, i should not have relicensed all, because
you maybe feel bad about things you "stole" or
copied, but the other things drove me into hundreds
of suicide attempts.
