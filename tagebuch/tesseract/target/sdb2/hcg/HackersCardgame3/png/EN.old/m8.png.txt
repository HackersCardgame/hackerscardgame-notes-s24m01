Inventor: God Year: ~B.C.
German: Zuckerbrot und Peitsche. The Brain tells
"child", you have to eat that again (because sugar
has a lot of energy) so you want more sugar/carrots.
Unfortunately, it is also possible, to use the carrot to
lead the child into the wrong direction: for example,
if someone would reward it, if brother pulls the little
sister at her hairs, this would a bad _ stimulus-
reaction-habit too. Parents who would do such crap
would deny the existence of Behavioral "Sciences"...

You get sweets almost in every store. so the kid
learns early to comsume at the sugar-armed
salesmen that would argue, that they are
Zacchaeus, chief tax-farmer and would claim that
they are entitled take the money for carrots.
