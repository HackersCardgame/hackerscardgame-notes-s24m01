Specific Events can trigger Actions, Events could be
Sounds, turning on Light-Switch (maybe evaluated by
smartmeter and the a list of what device uses how many
watts), images, Automatic Behavior Recognition, websites
(urls), Buttions or Mouse gestures on a computer, Handy
or even if you draw a circle with your hand in the air. One
can racognize events with Al (Pattern Recognition, Deep
Learning...)

For Example if JUrg S. would have fired illegally with a
weapon, this event would have been recorded and caused
an event in a Gunfire locator system [1].
