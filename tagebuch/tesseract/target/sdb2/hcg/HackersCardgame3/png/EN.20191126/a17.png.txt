Algorithm on my "computer" when i try to do things, to fix
things, to finish relevant business. There are problems like
extending pam-usb with udisk2 where unknown starts an
algorithm, that pervents me from solving the problem. The
algorithm starts tons of new problems that are also
relevant, | try to solve them all but always when i solved
80% of a tasks, the next problem opens or even starts a a
suicide death bot (a16) against me, Prevents that problems
are finally beeing solved. There are some sort of
"resonators" (Ingress), that prevent the whitehat hacker /
whistleblower from solving it. Resonators maybe just other
people that are beeing activated. If these are real people
they are maybe beeing activated with BigData from the
NSA / CIA Data Retention System that would prove earlier
sins of this human(?) "BOTs", Mathematically spoken
possibly / partitially transitive. tl... transmuts now "this is
non-solvable problem, hahaha" (= psychological warfare)
