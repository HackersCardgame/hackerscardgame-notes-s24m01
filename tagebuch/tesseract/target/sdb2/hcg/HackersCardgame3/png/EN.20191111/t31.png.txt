On Windows you can deploy group policies to a complete
domain. People that are some sort of wannabe hitlers
would enjoy it to impose their will upon others. | felt also
cool when i was about 25 Years old that i am the "Master"
but in fact i was just the scapegoat. Not quite sure if
those who depoloy things like al6, m50... to people or to
a complete group of people are just older people that are
using some similar software or if eg m50 card is deployed
on all domains, eg by the NSA/CIA/DSM5.

Giving a young whitehat hackers drugs like zyprexa or
illegal drugs (GFYS Matrix Red and Blue Pill) would let
them to think, i must have been infected when i ate this.
