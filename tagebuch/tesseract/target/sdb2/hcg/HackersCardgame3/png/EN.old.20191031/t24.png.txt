(Â¢:) GLASS SPHERE

Inventor: ???? Year: 2???
Thanks to the guy who has drawn this, i really like
that image. Look at the al4 card. | don't think that
all witches are black, there are maybe also Fortune
tellers, occultists, esoterics, fairies, trolls, non-
medical practitioners, Satanists(?) ... So bricking all
the spears would maybe cause more problems than
it would fix.

But giving the good ones that are not ees than
1978 some cards could

maybe help to find out

if he / she / it joined

the dark side or not.
