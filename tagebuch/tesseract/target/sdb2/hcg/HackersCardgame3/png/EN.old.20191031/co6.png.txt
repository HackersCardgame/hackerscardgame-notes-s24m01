With stimulus-reaction-habits,

(m8, see also card bl, b2, b3, tl...)
and after 1000 repetitions you will get punishment
instead of a reward (m7) things like like here would
happen. But the problem is if one has something like
a , then the whole reward /
punishment thing becomes obsolete. So in both
cases Windows / Computers can produce people that
run amok. But with spinal-cord remote controlled he
would not be the real murderer, and you can not
blame only him, because the person that remote
controlled him would just kill with the next "BOT". Try
to find both, the BOT and the person that tries to
make the "BOT" run amok. https://marclandolt.ch/
