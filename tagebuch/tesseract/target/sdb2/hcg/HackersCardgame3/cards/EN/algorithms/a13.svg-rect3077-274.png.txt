Inventor: Satan Year! 2???

Hierachical Systems tend to lack Moral. Most
Compynies have hierarchical structure often they
abuse small left wing people in the lowest rank to
make the customers think that the company and its
management is good and trustworthy. In case such a
left wing puncingball would upgrade to a
Whistleblower and find out about the dark
management and that they abuse the young people
as such punching balls they would possibly attack
him with al6, m38, t15.... Maybe played with al4,
which means that there will be also some bad left
wing people.

The Sad thing is, that this is business as usual.
