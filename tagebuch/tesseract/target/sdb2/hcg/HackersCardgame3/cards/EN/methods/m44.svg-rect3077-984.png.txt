Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~?2??2

Be careful and stick with equal aged. This image is
from ~2014. They can induce such behavior. | guess
they are using Cocaine, but the Cocaine is in my
opinion just licence-fees for computational timeslots
and malware on the Mainframe. Since they just pay,
consume and use it against me, they sure are one
part of the problem but they are not the intelligent
part of the problem.

It would be very likely, that good people would
develop such malware to prevent those 1960s
people from using their real weapons. If they beleive
that they are powerful and could kill me if they just
take enough of their cocaine, they will not run amok
against me or other innocent people.
