Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~?2??2

Originally an implant in the spinal cord (medulla
spinalis) that could force an orgasm, patented 40
Jears later 1999 under US6169924. Today maybe
encanced with more than just that "wire" (US Army
researches in this field) Output; the victim can be
"used" as a robot / soldier / killer or sex slave with a
3D model of the victim in a 3D environment (like
games) if all people would have such thing they
could create a weapon out of such technology and
unfortunately kill billions in a few seconds. Hopefully
those who created this system considered that
vulnerability. Mobile phone could act as UpLink to a
mainframe (the US Army maybe uses the Cry-Engine
with PhysX for the "Simulation")
