Lot of people live normal lives, living not as a saint
but also not a live as satan. They have their routine,
their places where they do things like hobbies and
where they look TV. But if one finds out, that his
company sold a software to a children hospital that
would risk lifes of kids and then tries to force the
chief to fix that chiefs tend to become angry about
such an employee.

When you are young you are maybe not aware of
such problems. A normal reaction of the chief would
be to intimidate the employee to stay silent, if you
are one of this sort of people that can't silent, it is
very likely to end up as a homeless, but maybe you
saved many lives of innocent kids.
