Also some sort of Limbic System Vulnerability Hack,
our brain is susceptible to the cute appearance of
children and reminds us of our (happy) childhood
with equal aged kids. This is "used" by advertising as
well as by people like Epstein that possibly used the
victims to get influence in politics, science...
Scientifically spoken: It is about "â€œWahrnehmungs-
psychologie", the shape of the head, which also
reminds us of ourclassmate in our childhood.
Sociopaths Ignorantly don't care about childrens
future, if they can sell more junk they would even
roast a child (maybe "only" with an active denial
system of course) if they just can make more profit...
this is a blue card with a kid, but the kids are the
victims not those who abuse this principle.
