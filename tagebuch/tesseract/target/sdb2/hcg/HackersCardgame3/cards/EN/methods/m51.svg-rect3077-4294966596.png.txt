Some people tend to load real Weapons to the , SO

stops to be a Game. This is my scouts knife that i got when i
was a 14 Years old boy. | used it as a toy and for woodwork. |
never attacked someone. In Switzerland they changed the law,
so this sort of tool is now declared as a weapon by law. | did
not even knew that i have this thing in a sealed wooden box.
But when they put me the 7th time in a Mental Institution the
Police @kapo_aargau searched all my stuff and found that
Knife and have put it on my table in my 1 room appartement,
Even when they knew that i am quite suicidal and that an
unknown Player always plays a16/dt3 card on me and that i
was dozend times in emergency room & already one night on
a ICU (Aarau). | destroyed the knife, but it's not a game at all.
In my opinion all Weapons should be destroyed globally. A
Weapon is a "Konditionierende" to a Relation (a12).
