One can produce situations, where people are played
off against each other. You could do this with drugs,
for example giving one person chemicals that make
happy and funny and the other person chemicals that
make sad. Wirst case both victims will begin to fight
each other while both victims think that he or she
does the right thing. Maybe such chemicals were
involved in Stanford prison experiment, unsure. But
with Technology cards (eg. tl...) you could possibly
produce similar situations. Or in Politics, race,
gender... or even just with showing good or bad
Facebook content (facebook experimetn, see Internet)
NOTICE THE UNSEEN THIRD. For example also to tell some
people that the accused younger boy is guilty and
therefor it would be "legitimite" that an older person
takes his goods would create the same situation, the
unjust decision os often in favour of the stronger
like Urs B. that has weapons... NOTICE UNSEEN THIRD.
