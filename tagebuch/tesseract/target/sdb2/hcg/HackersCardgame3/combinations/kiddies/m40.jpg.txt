Kids unfortunately learn early that they must be the
fittest and the first. ("maybe" some parents and
technolgy cards induce that intentionally, see sk1
card)

to avoid that behavior | repeat loud to myself

* first you win

* then you have fame

* then you are getting ignorant and lazy

* then you will have a knife in your back

Don't celebrate wins to much, remember there are
lot young people beeing abused and blackmailed by
older generations. Better invest your time to rescue
those younger victims
