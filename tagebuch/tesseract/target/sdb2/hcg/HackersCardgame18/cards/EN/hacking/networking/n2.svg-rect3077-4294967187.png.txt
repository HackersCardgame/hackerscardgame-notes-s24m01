Using a Network Monitoring Software like RRD, zenoss
or zabbix to monitor your gear is on one hand a good
idea, if someone donwloads gigabytes of data from
some of your computers you would maybe notice that
and ask legitimate question, even when satan does
not like questions, especially not legitimate
questions. On the other hand it's also not such a
great idea, at least not with SNMPv2. Link-Stat is only
one bit, but it would tell Satan, that you just enabled
your laptop and if he has something like the m98 card
he can guess, that you are now just in front of your
laptop. If the router or the switch that has also
SNMPv2 is hacked SNMPv3 whould also not make a
big difference. on one hand YAY, on the other hand
not that much of a YAY, but i'm Honey Pot anyway...
