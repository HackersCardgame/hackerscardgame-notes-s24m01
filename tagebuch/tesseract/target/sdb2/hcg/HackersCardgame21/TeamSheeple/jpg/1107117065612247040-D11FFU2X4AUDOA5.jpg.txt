Inventor Allan H. Frey (Cornell Uni) Year~1961
"Hears non-existent voices, hahaha" - an_ invisible
communication channels with pulsed microwaves
transmitted to and received directly by the cochlea. Was
30 Years not patented until 1989 under US4877027.
Technically it would have been possible to do this
already with electron tubes (~ 1900). Psychological
Perspective: people that abuse such technology would
find that very funny and previously labeled as a
"Schizophrenic" the victim is completely defenseless
and it is likely that it will run suicide or amok someday
Use Cases

In combination with e.g. a loop recorder, the perpetrators

often caused permanent damage in the psyche of their
