Hearing system

Abstract

US4877027.

‘Sound is induced in the head of a person by radiating the head with microwaves in the range of 100
‘megahertz to 10,000 megahertz that are modulated with a particular waveform. The waveform consists
of frequency modulated bursts. Each burstis made up of ten to twenty uniformly spaced pulses grouped
tightly together. The burst width is between 500 nanoseconds and 100 microseconds. The pulse width is
inthe range of 10 nanoseconds to 1 microsecond, The bursts are frequency modulated by the audio input
to create the sensation of hearing in the person whose head is irradiated. inients We Oainlnt
