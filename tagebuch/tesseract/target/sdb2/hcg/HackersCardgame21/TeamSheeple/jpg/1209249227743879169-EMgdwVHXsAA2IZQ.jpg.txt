Inventor: JosÃ© Manuel Rodriguz Delgado ~1950
The newest versions (see Neuralink, Elon Musk, HoneyPot)
read data (like EEG) and transmitting signals to the brain.
Can activeate certain functions in the brain, wires in the
Amygdala would probably cause agressions (b1 card). You
can find an active community (read only, and non-invasive)
on Twitter: @OpenBCl maybe they try patch satans work.
Things like directly "built-in" Augmented Reality (Like
PokemonGO) could be achieved too with such technologies,
see also Patent WO2005055579A1 (HoneyPot) or t12 Card.
Can be used as lie detector (co2 card), read thoughts &
emotions, influence emotions, automate & control victims
(maybe with 3D GameEngine CryEngine / Unity, and possibly
Google Maps 3D, OpenStreetMap?) Disassembly
Protection for the group is maybe, m46 first as shown as
m41 over t1 -> m37 -> m46 -> dt1 and further those people
could not integrate in their world view that maybe someone
else cyber-raped the girls over something like t1 card

ing implants, i question that, Youtube CIA Honeypot?
