The Prophet
CJ Bolland

I'm here to tear down everything around you

And you know whati'm going to replace it with?
God. the world of goa

So take your bread and give it to the poor

What difference does it matter what you own?

You have gold and silver its going to rot

And that rot ls going to eat away your heart

Allof you. there willbe a flood and there willbe a fire
Everything willbe destroyed

But there will be a new ark riding on that fre and i hold the keys
{And I open the door, and i decide who goes in and who doesn’t
You think god will answer only to you?

He doesn't

God's an immortal sprit who belongs to everybody - to the
whole world

You think your special?

God is not an istaelite
