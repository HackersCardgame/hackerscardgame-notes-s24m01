Warning
Phishing attack on Hostpoint customers

Dear Marc Landolt

ur support team is currently receiving numerous e-mails and calls regarding @
‘wave of phishing e-mails. In the past few days attackers have been sending
fake e-mails under Hostpoint’s name. These e-mails threaten the recipient that
their accounts will be deleted or locked if they do not act immediately. The
linked website leads to a fake login page that asks users to enter their login,
details for the Hostpoint Control Pane.

Hostpoint is not responsible for these e-mails and the website. If you
have received one of these messages, please delete it and do not
enter your login details! This is an attempt to gain unauthorized
access to your details.

IT you have followed the link in one of these e-mails and already entered your
login details, we urge you to change your password immediately. If you use the
same password for other services, we recommend that you also change it
there.

For more information about phishing, please refer to the corresponding
Information website provided by the Swiss Internet Security Alliance here:

I you have any questions, please contact our support team at +41 (0)844 04 04
04 or by e-mail at support@hostpoint.ch. Due to the current wave of phishing
‘e-mails, wating times may be longer than usual

Thank you for your understanding!

Best regards,
The Hostpoint team
