Gyrophone: Recognizing Spi

Abstract

We show that the MEMS gyroscopes found on mod-
ern smart phones are sufficiently sensitive to measure
acoustic signals in the vicinity of the phone. The re-
sulting signals contain only very low-frequency infor-
mation (<200Hz). Nevertheless we show, using signal
processing and machine learning, that this information is
sufficient to identify speaker information and even parse
speech. Since iOS and Android require no special per-
missions to access the gyro, our results show that apps
and active web content that cannot access the micro-
phone can nevertheless eavesdrop on speech in the vicin-
ity of the phone.

1 Introduction

Modern smartphones and mobile devices have many sen-
sors that enable rich user experience. Being generally
put to good use, they can sometimes unintentionally ex-
pose information the user does not want to share. While
the privacy risks associated with some sensors like a mi-
crophone (eavesdropping), camera or GPS (tracking) are
obvious and well understood, some of the risks remained
under the radar for users and application developers. In
particular, access to motion sensors such as gyroscope
and accelerometer is unmitigated by mobile operating
