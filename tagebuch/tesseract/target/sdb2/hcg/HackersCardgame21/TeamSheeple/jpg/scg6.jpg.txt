Since at least 1974 Hollywood shows’ technology
enthusiasts as Terrorists, criminals... for example in the
Movie "Juggernaut" where the "Hacker" wants to blow up a
passenger ship. So this mindset is in the heads of our
1960s Parents, except they are themselfe technology
enthusiasts. We guess that's one reason, why the older
generation sees us 1980s that like technology and also like
the "Hands On" from Hacker Etics as Criminals. But in fact
they only project their sins upon us. It's populism since a
technology enthusiast can maybe destroy the word but
also save the world. If a 1950s Parent was 30 years the
scapegoat he maybe would agree to give this role to a
1980s person, for not beeing the scapegoat anymore, but
still having higher access codes than the 1980s and
possilby much more sins that are beeing used to make the
1950s attack the 1980s scapegoat.
