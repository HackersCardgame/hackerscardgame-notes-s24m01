picks up speech from the user and the other placed in a position such that it
imparts speech and status signals audible to the user. The transducers may be

connected acoustically, either through bone contact or contact with other tissue, or mioelectrically, through electrodes connected to tissue or nerves. In future
telecommunications networks, when power level requirements are much lower, the whole device may be implanted and connected directly to a public mobile network
‘The system is further enhanced by the use of speech recognition technology, which makes operation of the device possible through voice or sound commands without
the use of manual actions. A further enhancement of the system would be a capability for image transfer through a device connected visually of electrically to the eyes
and a small camera to record what the eyes see. The characteristics of the device will emulate telepathy, in that it will give seemingly invisible voice and image
communication with others connected to the network:
