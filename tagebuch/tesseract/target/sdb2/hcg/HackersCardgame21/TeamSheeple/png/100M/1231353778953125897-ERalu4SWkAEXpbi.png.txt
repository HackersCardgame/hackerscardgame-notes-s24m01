Quantification was a chief concern of Hull's studies, and he continued to apply this interest to behaviorism.{241181 while in
koffka, he began to work towards a neobehaviorism.|3! His goal was to determine the laws of behavior and how they can |
could be built to replicate mental processes.(5)

In his book, Principles of Behavior] he developed the following formula

sEp = sHa X DX VK

Where:

sEp is excitatory potential (likelihood that the organism would produce response r to stimulus s),

st is the habit strength (derived from previous conditioning trials),

Dis drive strength (determined by, e.g., the hours of deprivation of food, water, etc.),

V is stimulus intensity dynamism (some stimuli will have greater influences than others, such as the lighting of a situation)
and Kis incentive (how appealing the result of the action is).{8il141

A variety of other factors were gradually added to the formula to account for results not included by this simple function. |
sEg = VXDXKXJX SHR - Ip - sla - sOp- sla

such that In is reactive inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that dissipates over time),

sik is conditioned inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that does not dissipate over time).

Hull originally intended to make a trilogy of books on behavior, explaining social and cognitive behavior!®! Instead, he fo

Hull's emphasis was on experimentation, an organized theory of learning, and the nature of habits, which he argued were
primary drives—such as hunger, thirst, sex, and the avoidance of pain. His systematic behavior theory, also known as driv
certain behaviors. Reinforcement of a response to a behavior supplies an effect that satisfies a need. In other words, this
needs, later described by Hull as cravings rather than needs, reduce these cravings. He called this concept drive-reductic

Other behaviorists found Hull's theories to be too cumbersome for practical use, leading to his work to be eclipsed by Skir
