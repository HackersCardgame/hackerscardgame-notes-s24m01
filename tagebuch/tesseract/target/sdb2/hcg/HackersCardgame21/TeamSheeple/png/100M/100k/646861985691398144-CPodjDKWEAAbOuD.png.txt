System for producing artificial telepathy
WO 2005055579 A1

ZUSAMMENFASSUNG

‘A device is proposed which will provide the user with a form of ariicial telepathy,
namely the ability to communicate with others with no obvious signs of
connection. The system comprises a mobile phone “engine' which interfaces to
an existing or future public mobile telephony network. This device also contains a
very low-power transponder, which Is linked wirelessly to one or more
corresponding transponders implanted in the body. Connected to these implanted
transponders are implanted transducers, one placed in a position such that it
picks up speech trom the user and the other placed in a position such that it
imparts speech and status signals audible to the user. The transducers may be

connected acoustically, either through bone contact or contact with other tissue, or mioelectrically, through electrodes connected to tissue or nerves. In future
telecommunications networks, when power level requirements are much lower, the whole device may be implanted and connected directly to a public mobile network
‘The system is further enhanced by the use of speech recognition technology, which makes operation of the device possible through voice or sound commands without
the use of manual actions. A further enhancement of the system would be a capability for image transfer through a device connected visually of electrically to the eyes
and a small camera to record what the eyes see. The characteristics of the device will emulate telepathy, in that it will give seemingly invisible voice and image

communication with others connected to the network.
