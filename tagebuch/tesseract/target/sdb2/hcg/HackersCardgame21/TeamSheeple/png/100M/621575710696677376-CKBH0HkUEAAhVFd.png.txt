Configuration Guide

In the previous section, you've learned about the various
‘types and categories of probes that NeuroNexus has to
offer. You also learned about the base probe com-
ponents. A unique combination of Probe Design
and Probe Package would result in a probe that
‘supports drug delivery, for example. The con-
figuration can be somewhat confusing, but
once you understand it you will appreciate
‘he flexibility and innovation of NeuroNexus
products.
NeuroNexus probes are batch-fabricated
in a state-of-the-art microfabrication clean
room. Although we offer a custom design
service, this cutting edge technology does
have a considerable cost commitment. To
reduce costs to our customers, we have selected
a variety of commonly requested electrode site ar-
rangements as our standard catalog probes.

In this section, you will learn how the probes are con-
figured and how to properly generate a part number for
order.
