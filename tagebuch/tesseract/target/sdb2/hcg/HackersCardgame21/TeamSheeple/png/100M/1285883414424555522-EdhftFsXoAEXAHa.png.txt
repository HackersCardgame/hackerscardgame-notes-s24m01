CIRCUITS Don’t Care Cell in the Kamnaugh Map

That s, we do not care what output our logic crcult produces for these don't cares.

jon’t Cares}

Dorit cares in a Karnaugh map, or truth table, may be either 15 or Os, as long as we dort care
What the output is for an input condition we never expect to see, We plot these cells with an
asterisk, *, among the normal 1s and Os.

When forming groups of cells, treat the don't care cell as either a1 or a 0, or ignore the dor't

This is helpful fit allows us to form a larger group than would otherwise be possible without the
don't cares, There iso requirement to group allor any of the dont cares.

Only use them in a group if it simplifies the logic.

Above is an example of a logic function where the desired output is 1 for input ABC = 101 over the
range from 000 to 101. We do not care what the output is forthe other possible inputs (110, 111).
Map those two as dont cares. We show two solutions.

The solution on the right Out = AB'C is the more complex solution since we did not use the don't

care cells. The solution in the middle, 0
