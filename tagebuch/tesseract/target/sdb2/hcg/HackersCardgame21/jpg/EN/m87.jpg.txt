Inventor: XXXXX Year: ~????

spontaneous discharge seems to be a voice keyword to pop
accuses from equal aged girls against the boys. They are done
in office jobs (project paperclip, see al7 card). So the old
generation keeps the problems active by not sending them to
the accused boys, because the boys would try to change their
behavior since they would be attracted by equal aged girls.
And maybe many of the accusistions are wrong, but by not
sending them the accused boy can not tell his part of the story
â€”=(auditur et altera pars). So both the young boys and the
young girls are victims of the older generatione. as already
said it would be very likely that eg. 1960s parents Cyber-Rape
1980s girls and just use the 1980s boys as scapegoats. The
Keyword then activates all accusitions against a boy that is
whistleblower or whitehat hacker. while the 1960 say "I wash
my hands in innocence". the keyword obfuscated by sexual
integrity things, see image.... isolating the accused from the
group does not imporve the situation...
