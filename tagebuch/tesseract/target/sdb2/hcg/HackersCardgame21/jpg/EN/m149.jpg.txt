It's "your"
own fault

Inventor: Year:
Tomorrow they possibly will force me_ to
"anti"psychotics. It's not medicine, it
brain, your intellect, your soul.
Generation kills you this way. So you
"reborn" as stupid robot. They will again abuse you
as scapegoat, and again you would have to pay the
bill for what the parental generation did. So i wish,
that all my tangible and intangible goods will be
inaccessable (maths: transitive) for people that are
older than the 1977s Generation. And that this
Cardgame will be distributed to younger people that
would maybe helps them to defend themselfes against
those people that hunts down inncent children in the
age uf 14 just because they bought an assembly book.
And to those that did this to me please repeat the
bible: Thou shalt not kill (

)
Dear older generation, Please remember this when you
end up in hell, and you will be there and guilty.
