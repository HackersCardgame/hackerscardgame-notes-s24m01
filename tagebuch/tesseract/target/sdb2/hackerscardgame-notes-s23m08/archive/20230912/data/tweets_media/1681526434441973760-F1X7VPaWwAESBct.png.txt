How much transmission power is required to induce 50mV to a golden wire that is 2em long
and hasa diameter of O:imm at 30GHz

To calculate the transmission power required to induce a specific voltage in a wire, we need.
to consider the wire's resistance, length, and the desired voltage. However, the wire's,
dimensions and material alone are not sufficient to determine its resistance at a given
frequency. More information about the wire's resistivity is needed.

‘The resistivity of gold is typically around 2.44 x 10*-8 ohm-meters at room temperature.
‘However, the resistivity may vary with temperature and other factors. To proceed with the
calculation, we will assume a resistivity of 2.44 x 10*-8 ohm-meters.

First, let's calculate the wire's cross-sectional area:

Area=m* (diameter/2)"2
=m? (GAmm/2r2
=344* (0.:05mmy2
=814* (6 x10°-5 m2
=814*25x 109 m2
= 785x109 m2

Next, let's calculate the wire's resistance using the resistivity and length:

Resistance = (resistivity * length) / area
= (2.44 x 10*-8 ohm-meters * 0.02 m) /(785 x 10%-9 m*2)
= (4.88 x 1040 ohm-m) / (785 x 10*-9 m*2)

= 6:22 10*-2ohms

To induce a voltage of SOmV across the wire, we can use Ohm's law:
