Hacker Culture -- Origins

The Art of Unix Programming -- by Eric Steven Raymond (p. 67)

But an old legend says, there was a telephone exchange systems that the students
got for free from AT&T that had been converted into a toy railroad control system,
and that the word "hack" was born there, but i can not prove that so far ...

difficult to label neatly. It has its own values and legends and folk heroes, partly overlapping with

those of the Unix tradition and partly derived from other sources. It has most often been called the

“hacker culture”, and since 1998 has largely coincided with what the computer trade press calls “the
‘open source movement”.

The relationships between the Unix tradition, the hacker culture, and the open-source movement
are subtle and complex. They are not simplified by the fact that all three implicit cultures have
frequently been expressed in the behaviors ofthe same human beings. But since 1990 the story of
Unix is largely the story of how the open-source hackers changed the rules and seized the initiative
from the old-ine proprietary Unix vendors. Therefore, the other half of the history behind today’s
Unis isthe history ofthe hackers.

At Play in the Groves of Academe: 1961-1980

The roots of the hacker culture can be traced back to 1961, the year MIT took delivery of its first
PDP-I minicomputer. The PDP-1 was one of the earliest interactive computers, and (unlike other

tachi) ofthe dey was icapeaive coongh th ene on id not have ob gil chee

the early days of the club. Their most famous achievement was SPACEWAR, a game of dueling
rocketships loosely inspired by the Lensman space operas of E.E. “Doc” Smith.'*

Several of the TMRC experimenters later went on to become core members of the MIT Artificial
Intelligence Lab, which in the 1960s and 1970s became one of the world centers of cutting-edge
computer science. They took some of TMRC’s slang and in-jokes with them, including a tradition

of elaborate (but harmless) PEARKSalledi*hacks™ The AI Lab programmers appear to have been
the first to deseribe themselves as “hackers”.

Afier 1969 the MIT AI Lab was connected, via the early ARPANET, to other leading computer
science research laboratories at Stanford, Bolt Beranck & Newman, Camegie-Mellon University and
elsewhere. Rescarchers and students got the first foretaste of the way fast network access abolishes
geography, often making it easier to collaborate and form friendships with distant people on the net
than it would be to do likewise with colleagues closer-by but less connected.

Software, ideas, slang, and a good deal of humor flowed over the experimental ARPANET links.
