hen a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, it

A network with a security vulnerability is insecure toithoselwhorknow
aboutthe vulnerability. Ifno one knows about it—ifits literally a vulnerabil-
ity that has not been discovered—then the network is secure. If one person

searchers know about it..if the hacking community knows about it—the in-
security of the network increases as news of the vulnerability gets out
