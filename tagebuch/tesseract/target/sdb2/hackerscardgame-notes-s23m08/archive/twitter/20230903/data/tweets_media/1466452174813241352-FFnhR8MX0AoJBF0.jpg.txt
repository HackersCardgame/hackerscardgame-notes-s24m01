FailDev Claim: These types of judges trigger #environmental, #CO2 & other #resource problems?
FailDev .
FailDev Premise:
FailDev These types of judges are in a military system of compulsory measures because they take the first of eg four million, and such a
company has to be rebuilt, which costs in each iteration the same amount of resources that was needed for the first one; after
the company n-1 had been sunken the production-goods have been split into many parts and therefor can no longer solve the
company’s job.

FailDev [III did not give up hope yet that anybody has access to something like the earth simulator, in my opinion world and CO2
cannot afford a military systems
