(TSIISUIREL) IRATEMONK Extended Concept of Operations

(TSIISWIREL) This technique supports systems without RAID hardware that boot
from a variety of Western Digital, Seagate, Maxtor, and Samsung hard drives. The
â€˜Supported file systems are: FAT, NTFS, EXT3 and UFS.

(TSIISWIREL) Through remote access or interdiction, UNITEDRAKE, or
'STRAITBAZZARE are used in conjunction with SLICKERVICAR to upload the hard
drive firmware onto the target machine to implant IRATEMONK and its payload (the
implant installer). Once implanted, IRATEMONK's frequency of execution (dropping
the payload) is configurable and will occur when the target machine powers on.
