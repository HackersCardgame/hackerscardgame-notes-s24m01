‘waaker, and more prone to errors, and thus usions. Moreover, wil also make i moe Hkely
thatthe representation ofthe pseudo tt weakens (through decay or interference) compared
to the strongly diferentated real letter representatons, thus making pseudoetters more prone
to eros andilusory memories overtime and interference. However, our findings clearly show
that pseudo ete targets do not simply lead to weaker memory traces. If that were the case,
patticants remembering a pseudoetter target (or more accurately, participant easily
forgetting a weakly estabished representation of a pseudo ‘ete target) should be selecting a
items in the probe display with equal probably, asthe representation ofthe target has been
lost This should result in similar rats of errors (Selecting probe items that are nol the target, oF
a mirrored version of the target) and ilusions (selecting the mirored version ofthe target), Our
results show that this is nat the case: lusory memories are much more common than other
errors when te target was a pseudo letter. Moreover, the incidence of expectation induced
ilsory memories increases asthe memory trace weakens, and this not or rather, much
less) the case for other errs

Athough predictive processing provides a comfortable framework with which to account for our
results regarding STM, we recagnize that there is already a vas iterature about the theoretical
foundations of false memary in LTM. For example, one explanation forthe occurrence of
itusions in LTM comes fom (47). states that memory consists of two
pats, a verbatim part, representing the exact memory input and a gist part, representing the
meaning ofthe input, based on a semantic analyss. Could il also explain the current
findings in STM? itis possible that the verbatim representation ofthe visual input is the physical
pseudo-leter, and tha the high-ovel gst tha is sored is something ike “eter” and ‘mitroed”
with such a representation, itis possible tha theless stronger than the “mirored” gs
thus surviving longer. However, ll predicts that high simianty between a target and is
‘ictored counterpat should inhib false memories [4}. Ths isnot consistent withthe current
‘data: The mirrored counterpart (the rea ltr) and the target (the pseudolete) are extremely
sila, yet false memories ae abundant. Therefore, seems that cannot accurately
account forthe occurrence of ti type of memory lusions in STM. In contrast to, which
suggests that memory ilusions are the result of high-level semantic analysis, thus seems

‘hat, atleast for memory ilusons in STM, very basic perceptual expectations can directly
shape memory representations, Thereore, based on these considerations we argue that
‘cannot entirely explain the current findings.

[loves suggest that pseudo tors have a verbal (the lter tse) and a gist level
(Cmirored representation, while real lees can be stored purely atthe verbal level, This
‘would mean that verbal rehearsal is moc elective o store a complete representation of real
lees in working memory, but nol for pseudoJetters. Removing verbal rehearsal asa strategy,
for example trough articulatory suppression, would therefore impact the storage ofthe verbal
