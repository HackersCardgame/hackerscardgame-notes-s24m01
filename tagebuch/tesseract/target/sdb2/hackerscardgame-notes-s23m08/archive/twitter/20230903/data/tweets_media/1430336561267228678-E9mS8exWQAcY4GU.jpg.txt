For Example to derive the concept how to make
security people to go against peoples in
poor areas to gentrify the area, i normally use
the Facebook study that proves that people can
be manipulated by SocialMedia or Computers. The
Security People is in our opinion just an NPC that
is abused by some rich people, rich are the
beneficiary from gentrification not the security
people. May a virtual Concert Piano hit those
people. As a community we should create
additional offline storage / Libraries for such
relevant articles, since they already go against
archive.org. | guess archive.org is already hacked
by the criminals, but to make it look legitimate
they now started with LawFare against
archive.org
