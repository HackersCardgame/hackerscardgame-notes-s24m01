The malware used by the Equation team shares many similarities with the likes of Stuxnet,
Flame, Gauss, and Regin, with a worm called Fanny, created to bridge air-gap systems, using
two of the same zero-day vulnerabilities which were subsequently used by Student.

In its report Kaspersky says the Equation group malware could have been used to deliver the
Stuxnet malware. The group also used a virtual file system which was present in the Regin
malware, which leaked Snowden documents show was used by the NSA to infect state-
owned Belgian firm Belgacom.

Finally, an advanced keylogger known as GPOK is referenced in the Equation team's source
code. The name Grok was previously mentioned in another leaked Snowden document about

an SERRE eee of the same name.

It may not be spelled out explicitly, but there is no doubt that the US government is
sponsoring the actions of the Equation group.

Why the name ‘Equation team’?
Kaspersky Labs experts say the reason they have dubbed this group the Equation team is
“because of their love for encryption algorithms and obfuscation strategies and the

sophisticated methods used throughout their operations"

How long has Equation group been operating?
