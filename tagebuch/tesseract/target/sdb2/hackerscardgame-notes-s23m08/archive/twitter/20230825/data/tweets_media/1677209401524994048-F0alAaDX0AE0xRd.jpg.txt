Koffka, he began to work towards a neobehaviorism.'°) His goal was to determine the laws of behavior and how they
can be used to determine future behaviors.!SIl5] His work with the computing machine led him to believe a machine
could be built to replicate mental processes. |)

In his book, Principles of Behavior,'\4] he developed the following formula:

sEr = sHr*xDxVxK

situation),
and K is incentive (how appealing the result of the action is),!®l"9)

A variety of other factors were gradually added to the formula to account for results not included by this simple
function. Eventually the formula became:

sER=VxDxKxJxsHR-IR-slk- sOR-slk

such that Ip is reactive inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that dissipates over time),
slg is conditioned inhibition (inhibition caused by continual performance of a behavior that does not dissipate over
time).l"5] gLp is Reaction threshold, the smallest amount of reinforcement that will produce learning.

Hull originally intended to make a trilogy of books on behavior, explaining social and cognitive behavior.!5) Instead, he

focused on continuously revising his original formula as exceptions showed up.!51
