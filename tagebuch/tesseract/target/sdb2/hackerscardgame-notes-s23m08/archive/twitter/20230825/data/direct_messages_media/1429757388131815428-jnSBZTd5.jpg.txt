just forcing everyone who connects to an anonymity system to reset just the same way that the Chinese do
right now in China with the Great Firewall of China. So that’s like the NSA builds the equivalent of the Great
Firewall of Earth. That's, to me that’s a really scary, heavy-handed thing, and I’m sure they only use it for
good. (clears throat)

[laughter]

But, yeah. Back here in reality, that to me is a really scary thing, especially because one of the ways that
they are able to have this capability, as | mentioned, is these diodes. So what that suggests is that they
actually repurpose other people’s machines in order to reposition and to gain a capability inside of an area
where they actually have no legitimacy inside of that area. That to me suggests it is not only heavy-handed,
that they have probably some tools to do that. You see where I’m going with this.

Well, QUANTUMINSERTION, this is also an important point, because this is what was used against
Bélgacom, this is what's used by a whole number of unfortunately players in the game where basically what
they do is they inject a packet. So you have a TCP connection, Alice wants to talk to Bob, and for some
reason Alice and Bob have not heard about TLS. Alice sends an HTTP request to Bob. Bob is Yahoo. NSA
loves Yahoo. And basically they inject a packet which will get to Alice before Yahoo is able to respond, right?
And the thing is that if that was a TLS connection, the man-on-the-side attack would not succeed. That’s
really key. If they were using TLS, the man-on-the-side attack could at best, as far as we understand it at the
moment, they could tear down the TLS session but they couldn’t actually actively inject. So that’s a man-on-
the-side attack. We can end that attack with TLS. When we deploy TLS everywhere, then we will end that
kind of attack.

So there was a joke, you know, when you download .mp3s, you ride with communism — from the’90s, some
of you may remember this. When you bareback with the internet, you ride with the NSA.
