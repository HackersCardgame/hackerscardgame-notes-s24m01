‘weaker, and more prone o errors, and thus usions. Moreover, wil also make i more Ikely
thatthe representation ofthe pseudo tt weakens (through decay or interference) compared
to the strongly diferentated real letter representatons, thus making pseudoetters more prone
to eros andilusory memories overtime and interference. However, our findings clearly show
that pseudo ete targets do not simply lead to weaker memory traces. If that were the case,
patticants remembering a pseudoetter target (or more accurately, participant easily
forgetting a weakly estabished representation of a pseudo ‘ete target) should be selecting a

lost This should result in similar rats of errors (Selecting probe items that are nol the target, oF
a mirrored version of the target) and ilusions (selecting the mirored version ofthe target), Our
results show that this is nat the case: lusory memories are much more common than other
errors when te target was a pseudo letter. Moreover, the incidence of expectation induced
ilsory memories increases asthe memory trace weakens, and this not or rather, much
less) the case for other errs

Athough predictive processing provides a comfortable framework with which to account for our
results regarding STM, we recagnize that there is already a vast iterature about the theoretical
foundations of false memary in LTM. For example, one explanation forthe occurrence of
itusions in LTM comes fom [7]. FTT states that memory consists of two
pats, a verbatim pat, representing the exact memory input, and a gist part, representing the
meaning ofthe input, based on a semantic analyss. Could FTT also explain the current
findings in STM? itis possible that the verbatim representation ofthe visual inputs the physical
seudo-leter, and tha the high-level gist that is sored is something ike “eter and ‘mitrored”
‘with such a representation, itis possible tha thelr’ gist is stronger than the “mirored” gs
thus surviving longer. However, FTT predicts that high simianty between a target and is
rictored counterpat should init false memories [4}. Ths isnot consistent withthe current
‘data: The mirrored counterpart (he rea ltr) and the target (the pseudolete) are extremely
simular, yet false memories ae abundant. Therefore, seems that FTT cannot accurately
account or the occurrence of tis type of momoy lusions in STM. In contrast to FTT, which
suggests that memory ilusions are the result of high-level semantic analysis, thus seems

‘hat, atleast for memory ilusions in STM, very basic perceptual expectations can directly
shape memory representations, Thereore, based on these considerations we argue that FTT
‘cannot entirely explain the current findings.

FTT does suggest that pseudo-oters have a verbal the eter iso) and agit level

for example trough articulatory suppression, would therefore impact the storage ofthe verbal
