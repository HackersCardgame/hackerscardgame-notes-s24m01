In computer science, thrashing occurs in a system with virtual memory when a computer's real storage resources are
overcommitted, leading to a constant state of paging and page faults, slowing most application-level processing"! This causes the
performance of the computer to degrade or collapse. The situation can continue indefinitely until either the user closes some running
applications or the active processes free up additional virtual memory resources.

After completing initialization, most programs operate on a small number of code and data pages compared to the total memory the
program requires. The pages most frequently accessed at any point are called the working set, which may change over time.

When the working set is not significantly greater than the system's total number of real storage page frames, virtual memory systems.
work most efficiently and an insignificant amount of computing is spent resolving page faults. As the total of the working sets grow,
resolving page faults remains manageable until the growth reaches a critical point. Then faults go up dramatically and the time spent
