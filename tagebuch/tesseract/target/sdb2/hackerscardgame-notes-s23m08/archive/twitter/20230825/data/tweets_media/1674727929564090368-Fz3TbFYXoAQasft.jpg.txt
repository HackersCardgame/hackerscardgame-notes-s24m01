Moderator: Thank you very much, Jake. Thank you. I’m afraid we ran all
out of time for the Q&A. I’m very sorry for anyone who wanted to ask
questions.

Jacob Appelbaum: But we do have a press conference. Well, if you guys
— you know, I’d say occupy the room for another five minutes, or, know
that there’s a press conference room that will be opened up where we can
all ask as many questions as we want in 30 minutes if you’re interested,
and | will basically be available until I’m assassinated to answer
questions.

Moderator: Thank you. Please give a warm round of applause to Jake
Appelbaum.
