This card is just to show, that there are
consumer devices that can communicate
with satellites without a big dish. Eg. Spot3
can transmit only a few bytes, but that would
be sufficient to get eg. new keys for a bigger
global surveillance nightmare or to activate a
CodeRED against a person that asks to much
relevant question, identified maybe by
something like a GUID (Global Unique
|Dentifier)
