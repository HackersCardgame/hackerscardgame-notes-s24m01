NSAICIA would like to make a #HoneyPOT out of that
Product and even blame Elon if things go wrong, that

Neuronexus on the coin

If Elon tries to mitigate the problems the older
Implants causes this would be really great.

device and the supplier, If NSA/CIA uses
Scapegoats for things they have done the
would suggest local Juristications to. do this
sort of surveillance, but the device and
infrastructure would be owned by the CIAINSA
to make the local Juristication beleive that the
Scapegoat is really the criminal. First Problem
would be that the real criminal is stil free and
planing maybe already the next Crime and
Secondly the Scapegoat would then driven to
commit suicide and the Jurstication could only
say. "It is fair that the Criminal died" but they

Swiss Military
Drone

Inventor: 777

Switzerland has Drones, possibly attached also to
INTAF (t43 Card), possibly also using Miltary Fiber
Backbone (n3) and it is also likely that they have
'SDR's mounted forthe less nice things lke £19 Card or
‘ther “funny” things. Maybe they also can Control
[NPC's with such drones like Michael 8 (Blick.ch called
him Grosimorder). | think it would be easy to find out if
sniss army had 3 reason to kil her with the hands of
her own grandchild. This is just speculation, but if 19,
Card can be proven on such drones it would be likely
that they use them also for Behavioral "Sciences".
{Good thing seems to be that they can not fly oF only
reduced when It rains. So doing a bycicle tour by night
and rain sounds maybe like a bad idea, but maybe
isn't at all and one would find aut about eg. t1 al

‘Today this seems to be fiktered by google, but you
find it on admin.ch, And if you search this on google
‘you find the websited on the right side of the card
image that seems to be also a new article, maybe
backdated? This would imply, that swiss army can
{force google to filter things, and that implies that we
may mess with the same military dicatatorship..

‘They told this some soldiers in Art RS232 in ~1999,
INTAF means integriertes Feuer und Feuerleitsystem
‘oder so. There they can enter there the targets to
hunt down, eg with Panzernaubizen and it "maybe"
Uses the NPC's and the fiber Network from the n3

Swiss Military
Mainframe

If t40 to t45 Cards can be prooven then it would be
likely that there is also a swiss army mainframe.
Maybe one could find that with an estimation of its
ower consumption It isnot clear to me or us, If NSA
‘CIA (Card 135) should just obfuscate maybe the last
bastion of Satan, or if its to train the people for the
Miltary. Train in miltary context context would
ssibly mean to make them kill fr example an equal
Jed, seal that fle and blackmail the trainee the rest
‘of his lve with his deed (see m37 Card). Some did not
kill some are just scapegoat for others. Maybe we can
‘get them back to heaven. But if we would “play" "red

Colateral damage. We hope there is a way through
Denhag curt or amnesty to prevent them being evil
