Nature One is one of the largest European open air Electronic music festivals, featuring many renowned DJs from Germany and all over the world. In significance it is not
as big as Mayday nor as old, having started 3 years later than the Mayday festival. However attendance has surpassed the Mayday, even when one takes into account that
the Mayday only lasts one evening, while the Nature One has 2 main evenings with additional smaller events from Thursday till Sunday.
