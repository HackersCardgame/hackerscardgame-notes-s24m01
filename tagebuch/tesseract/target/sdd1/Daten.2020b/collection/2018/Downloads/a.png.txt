Hearing system

Abstract

US4877027A

US Grant

Sound is induced in the head of a person by radiating the head with microwaves in the range of 100
megahertz to 10,000 megahertz that are modulated with a particular waveform. The waveform consists

of frequency modulated bursts. Each burst is made up of ten to twenty uniformly spaced pulses grouped
tightly together. The burst width is between 500 nanoseconds and 100 microseconds. The pulse width is
inthe range of 10 nanoseconds to 1 microsecond, The bursts are frequency modulated by the audio input

Description Claims (8)

This invention relates to a hearing system for human beings in which high frequency Iclaim:
electromagnetic energy is projected through the air to the head of a human being and
the electromagnetic energy is modulated to create signals that can be discerned by the
human being regardless of the hearing ability of the person.
