Exercise 5: A smaller rowboat

In the traditional version of this puzzle the robot can only fit one thing on the boat with
it. The state space is still the same, but fewer transitions are possible. Use the state
transition diagram below to find a path from the initial state to the final one (we

suggest drawing this out to really try).
Your task is now to calculate the length of the shortest path to get from NNNN to FFFF.

Please type your answer as the number of transitions in the shortest path. (just a
single number like "12",) (Hint: Using a paper and a pen might help when doing this

exercise.)
