MEMES
I had seen many pictures and heard many people discuss the cemeteries,
but even knowing about these cemeteries in advance, I was still not
prepared for the sight.

Simple, white, wooden crosses stretching from the fields beside the
roadway, seemingly without end, into the horizon. Their number
uncountable, the representation of their loss unfathomable. I pulled my
rental car over, and sat, staring at these crosses and contemplating how it
was that despite these men and womens sacrifice, despite their bravery,
we had still fallen so far.I broke into tears, sobbing alone in the car,
staring at the crosses, at the forgotten dead.
