assume you want to know what a PHP session means for you, the programmer.

When you do session_startQ you are telling PHP that you want to use the session. This is
made available to you as an array called $_ SESSION. You can use that like any other array
with the difference that the stuff you put in there stays there from one page to another
(provided you use session_startQ at the beginning of each page)

The actual mechanism may vary depending on configuration (php Jini), but a typical installation
can use cookies for the session. Let's assume that your webserver is on linux and you're using
cookies. You do the following

session_start();
$_SESSTON['nane']="Bob' ;

When PHP sees this it creates a text file with a semi-random name (for example
sess_a3tfkd5558kt5rlm44i538f]07), sticks the $_ SESSION contents in there as plain text and
then sends a cookie to the user with the session id, which can be used to find the session file
(for example a3tikdS558Kf5rim44i538f07).

The next time the user comes back he hands in the session id in his cookie, PHP goes to the
relevant file and loads its contents in $_SESSION.

You'll note that the actual information is kept on the server while the user is only given an id.

so fl start session on each page, how does PHP know to maintain the same info from the $SESSION
variable from the last page, that cookie? — Scott Oct 25 10 al 15.42,

1 @Scott- Ifthe user has a cookie with an session id matching an existing session (existing session file),
session_startQ resumes the session. Otherwise it starts a new one, ~ ilanos Dilaverakis Oct 26 'L0 at

Like it says in the Manual

session_start() creates a session or resumes the current one based on a session
identifier passed via a GET or POST request, or passed via a cookie

Ifyou start a new session at your login page, the session is initially empty. You can store in it
whatever you want, for instance, store the user id once the user has logged in. The session
data is destroyed when you close the session

You might want to read all chapters in the Session Extension Manual Pages and also see

+ what is session and cookies in php and where it stored
