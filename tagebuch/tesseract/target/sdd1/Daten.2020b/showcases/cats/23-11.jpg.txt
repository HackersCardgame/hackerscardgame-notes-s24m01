SK Shapes of Dita

1) SHAPELESS 2) INFLATED.
LIKE MANY OTHER CATS, USUALLY LOOKING DRAMATICALLY FAT WHEN
DITA CAN BE FOUND IN HER WE TRY TO CONVINCE SOMEONE
LIQUID STATE ‘THAT SHE Is NOT OVERWEIGHT

3) ELONGATED
IF YOU WANT TO SHARE A SOFA OR BED WITH DITA, SHE BECOMES VEE-ERY LONG.
‘SO THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO SPARE SPACE TO SHARE. NO WAY.

4) NARROWED 5) "ROCK"
ONCE SHE'S ASKING FOR FOOD — VET CARRIER TURNS DITA INTO A
IT'S A VERY SKINNY CAT. WEIRDLY SHAPED, VERY STIFF ANIMAL

THAT JUST WONT FIT INSIDE.
