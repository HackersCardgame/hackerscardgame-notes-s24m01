and | wanted to keep it seperate from the real repo where you are working on

so you dont get any file conflicts

or he was touching anything what he shouldnt

just to keep it seperate *

in that repo there is a dir with the cfg files, nothing more

ok, so in this case we have different systems to test, this would really be good if the developer would know about that, because in this case we can have problems because of the
changes of the code or the different config files in the db

what do you mean?

have you tested the new version from today with the test config files or wiht your private files?

no from the one in the main pri repo

because i can do whatever i want, i can not reporduce the error

onlything what changed in the cfg file was a user password

its running since 10h whitout any error, without any crash

the only thing what different with yours and our server is that we get udp triggers

whats*

so if you would like to receive those as well | need to forward them to your server

maybe it will crash then as well ‘=

because thats the only thing whats different

and i feel bad if it does not work, and even more if i can not reproduce, and if you have some different config files this could explain why i can not reproduce, mine is running since 10h
and i sent several thousend udps to it, no problem, no crash

you didnt had the tvmaze error yesterday as well *

and | could repoduce it

no, inever had this error

and i also cannot reproduce

| gave you yesterday how you could reproduce it

but this didnt work

the thing i saw i already fixed, that was caused by a bad formulated sql query and this one i fixet today

well all | know is that | dont keep something from you or whatever you just suggested

suggest*

Im trying to test everything and help where ever | can

keeping things from you doesnt make sense

well that you have additional configs really really would be something i need to know, since if try to find the bug and dont know anything about that, how can ifind the bug ifi dont
even know that they exist?

is the revision# built in by now? so i could tell you what version irun. it just took 1.8sec for a movie and ‘test’ isn't working so i cant ‘call’ the tvmaze error
stalefish: | didnt restart it on groot | think

just on nebula

ok. any idea why ‘test’ is gone! ‘=

2

probably Im hiding it :) \

boris, still not answered my question

is the database and the system where you test the new code complete identical with my repo or is the database different?
Irun the same cfg files as in the repo!

already told you ‘>

not the updated ones

only change is a password in a cfg file

ok

so lets scroll back 4h where i suggested to make a teamviewer session on this machine for me to find the bug
