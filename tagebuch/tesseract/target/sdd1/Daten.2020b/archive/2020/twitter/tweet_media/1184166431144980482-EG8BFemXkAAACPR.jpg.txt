To call soldiers "scapegoats" would be wrong.
Everyone with a weapon has power. And power
tends to be abused.

| don't want to put this image here, but since it
seems to disapear on the internet and since it is of
historical value to show what military often does to
the smallest i put this in my repository.

if you watch the "Collateral Murder Video" and listen
to the soldier you will find out, that also 50 Years
later nothing changed except those like Chelsea
Manning who spoke out what is currently going
wrong in the US Army.
