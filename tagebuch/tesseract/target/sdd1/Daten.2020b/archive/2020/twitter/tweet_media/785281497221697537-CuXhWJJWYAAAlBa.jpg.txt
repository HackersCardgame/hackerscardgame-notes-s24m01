Just months before 9/11, the world Trade
Center's lease was privatized and sold
to Larry Silverstein.

Silverstein took out an insurance plan
that ‘fortuitously’ covered terrorism.

After 9/11, Silverstein took the insurance
company to court, claiming he should be
paid double because there were 2 attacks.
Silverstein won, and was awarded
$4,550,000,000.
