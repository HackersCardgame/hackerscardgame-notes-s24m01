EEG Data As Received)

Inventor: Year:

I did not find any image from such a device. In
Psychiatrie K6énigsfelden (P4) there is an EEG
installation. They measure your EEG with electrodes
and flashlights. The flashligt cause peeks on the EEG?
Unsure if that was "service" of the mental institution
and they just tried to find out my _ perceptual
threshold. The problem was that someone used this data
on the street or in my car and also flashed me, that
revictimized the scene in the Mental Institution and
made me massive paranoid. I dont knwo if psychological
terror on the street was intentional or if this was
that just that eg the CIA stole the data and abused it
against me. My opinion: Kénigsfelden is guilty too.
