‘The world is not divided hetween East and West. You are
American, Iam Iranian, we don’t know each other, but we
talk and we understand each other perfectly. The difference
between you and your government is much bigger than the
difference between you and me. And the difference between
me and my government is much bigger than the difference
between me and you.

‘And our governments are very much the same.

- Marjane Satrapi, Iranian Graphic Novelist
