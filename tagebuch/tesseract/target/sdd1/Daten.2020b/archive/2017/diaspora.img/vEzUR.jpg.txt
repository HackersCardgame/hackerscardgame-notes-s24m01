"Apple is the pioneer in designing
computers to restrict their users
[freedom] even more - and the users
recognize this. When they speak
about breaking some of the digital
handcuffs in the 'i' things, they call it
"jailbreaking", which recognizes that
those computers are designed as
jails. If you don't want to live in jail,
don't use them."
