Being In A Relationship With
An Engineer.

Her Diary

Tonight, | thought my husband was acting
weird. We had made plans to meet at a nice
restaurant for dinner. | was shopping with my
friends all day long, so | thought he was upset
at the fact that | was a bit late, but he made no
comment on it. Conversation wasn't flowing,
so | suggested that we go somewhere quiet
so we could talk. He agreed, but he didn't say
much.

| asked him what was wrong; He said,
‘Nothing..’ | asked him if it was my fault that
he was upset. He said he wasn't upset, that it
had nothing to do with me, and not to worry
about it. On the way home, | told him that |
loved him. He smiled slightly, and kept
driving. | can't explain his behavior. | don't
know why he didn't say, ‘I love you, too."

When we got home, | felt as if | had lost him
completely, as if he wanted nothing to do with
me anymore. He just sat there quietly, and
watched TV. He continued to seem distant
and absent. Finally, with silence all around
us, | decided to go to bed. About 15 minutes
later, he came to bed. But | still felt that he
was distracted, and his thoughts were
somewhere else. He fell asleep; | cried. | don't
know what to do. I'm almost sure that his
thoughts are with someone else. My life is a
disaster.
