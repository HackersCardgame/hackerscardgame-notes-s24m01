Gameboy Raspberry Pi... | feel like | could
cry...

The Gameboy will always hold a fond place in my childhood
heart. | have always wanted a Gameboy Light, but they were
never released in the US and the ones on eBay in decent
condition are pretty pricey.

Given that, | built my own.

Running for the first time with the modified
LCD screen

In order for this project to work, the LCD had to be modified to
run off of 5 volts. After several failed attempts at finding a 5V in,
lucked on it!

Yes, it runs DOOM!

â€œSlaten <<

Removed the 12V Power regulator and jump soldered to the in
Capacitor. Works like a charm at 5V!

Work all done, firing up with the battery for
the first time

| found a pretty cheap 4800mAH external battery that puts out
5V, 1AMP which should power it for decent amount of time.

Best Gameboy game?
