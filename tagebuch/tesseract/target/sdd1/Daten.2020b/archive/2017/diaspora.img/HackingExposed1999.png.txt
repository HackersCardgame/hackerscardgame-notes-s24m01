FOREWORD

hen a tree falls in the forest and no one is around to hear it, it

certainly makes a sound. But if a computer network has a security

vulnerability and no one knows about it, is it insecure? Only the
most extreme Berkeleian idealist might argue against the former, but the
latter is not nearly so obvious.

insecure to

A network with a security vulnerability is insecure to those who know
about the vulnerability. If no one knows about it—f it is literally a vulnerabil-

ity that has not been discovered—then the network is secure. If one person
knows about it, then the network is insecure to him but secure to everyone
else. If the network equipment manufacturer knows about it...if security re-
searchers know about it...if the hacking community knows about it—the in-
security of the network increases as news of the vulnerability gets out.
