DUBAI

CITY OF THE FUTURE

Heaven-defying architecture, 3D-printed buildings, self-driving cars, and
Pneumatic Hyperloop transports. It reads like every futurist’s wish list—but
for Dubai, tomorrow is today, and this ambitious emirate is taking the lead
with countless projects, completed and planned. Let's take a look at why

Dubai really is the City of the Future

SccermesUtuire, create the future’ —that s the motto of the
Museum of the Future, slated to open in December 2018.
But instead of curating the artifacts of the past, this
museum will serve as an incubator for future innovations.
It's envisioned as the research and development arm of
the country’s forward-thinking Ministry
of the Future, which seeks solutions
to nascent problems and aims to
craft the UAE's roadmap toa
post-oil future.

ROBOT ,
OLYMPICS

Starting in 2017, Dubai plans to host a “Robot
Olympics” every two years. The games will
include nine events: driverless car racing,
manned drone races, unmanned drone races,
robotic running, robotic soccer, robotic
swimming, robotic table tennis, robotic
wrestling, and even a “cybathlon” event.
Move over, Michael Phelps...

Dubai's newest architectural wonder, slated for
completion in 2020, is called, simply, The Tower at
Dubai Creek Harbour. The projected $1 billion-dollar
spire is more of an ornament than a

functional building—a 928-meter
(3,044-foot) sculpture in gleaming
metal, cocooned in a webwork of
cable stays. It will be 100 meters

(328 feet) taller than the Burj Khalifa,
and comes complete with a te
boutique hotel, vertical gardens,
restaurants, and a 360-degree
observation deck.

The Dubai Future Foundation will host a
contest in September to design a Hyperloop
system from Dubai to Fujairah—a distance of
105 kilometers (65 miles) that could be
covered in less than 10 minutes. Meanwhile,
the Dubai-based port operator DP World
hopes to use Hyperloop technology to
transport cargo from the Jebel Ali Port to
an inland container depot.

Earlier this year, Dubai unveiled the world’s first 3D-printed office
building—a sleek, futuristic structure that took only 17 hours and a
handful of electricians and craftsmen to print, install, and equip for
use. It’s the first step toward a revolutionary new construction
technique in a city famous for its architectural innovation.

Dubai hosted the “World
Drone Prix" in March—the
first of its kind.

150 competitors

assembled to pit their
drone-piloting skills against
one another on a 591-meter
purpose-built aerial drone
racing course. The champ,
a British teenager, won a
prize of $250,000—and you
can bet this new sport is

here to stay

Surely Dubai's most ambitious project—if it’s
ever really undertaken—will be the Ziggurat
Pyramid. Conceived as a pyramidal arcology

capable of housing a population of 1 million
souls, the Ziggurat Pyramid would be fully
self-sufficient, using natural and renewable

energy sources, and will eschew the need for
fuel-burning vehicles altogether with an

Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al
Maktoum, Emir of Dubai and Vice
President and Prime Minister of the

UAE, announced a push to have
25% of Dubai's transportation

system using artificial intelligence

and driverless systems by 2030

If successful, the Gulf city-state

will have the “smartest” and .
likely safest transportation \
system in the world. | \

Dubai experiences four not-so-distinct

seasons—dry and drier, hot and hotter.
If only they had a mountain to better
regulate the climate... Hoping to defy
the shortcomings of geography, the

government of Dubai is seriously
studying the prospect of building
a rainfall-boosting, man-made
mountain. Forget the Ziggurat Pyramid
rp arcology—this is geoengineering at its
»>™ most ambitious.
