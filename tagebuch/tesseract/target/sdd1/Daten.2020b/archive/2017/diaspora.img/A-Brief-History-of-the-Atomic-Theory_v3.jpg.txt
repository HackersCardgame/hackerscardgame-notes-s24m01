HOW THE ATOM
CAME TOGETHER

A Brief History of the Atomic Theory

By Todd Jaquith

h more likely his mentor
Leucippus) is credited with putting forth the idea of
&topot, or “indivisibles’—minute and indestructible
particles, whose many shapes and forms constitute
the different states of matter.

BILLIARD

BALL MODEL
1803

In the early 19th Century, English chemist John Dalton
resurrected Democritus’ atomic theory, proposing that
all matter is composed of tiny atoms, indestructible
particles that combine in different ways to make up the
recognized elements. It was the beginning of the
ascent toward the modern quantum theory.

1904

A century after Dalton’s theory, English physicist J. J.
Thomson advanced the “plum pudding” hypothesis, which
attempted to explain the existence of the newly discovered
electrons. The model held that negatively-charged electrons
floated within a positively-charged sector of space, which in
turn made atoms electrically neutral.

RUTHERFORD

MODEL
1911

Devised by Ernest Rutherford, this new model
abandoned the “plum pudding” concept of diffuse
electrons and charged spaces for a more accurate
version: a positively-charged nucleus, containing most
of the atom’s mass, around which negatively-charged
electrons orbit like planets about a sun.

The Bohr model, elaborated by Danish physicist Niels Bohr,
superseded the Rutherford model, only in that it introduced
the notion of multiple electron orbits—analogous to
planetary orbits—sustained by electrostatic forces.

QUANTUM

MECHANICAL MODEL
1926

Assembled by Erwin Schrédinger from the new and
surprising physics of quantum mechanics, this model
has produced the truest depiction yet of the atom. It’s
a bizarre and counterintuitive model—electrons don’t
inhabit precise orbits but rather exist as “probability
clouds,” a diffuse area where there is only a
mathematical likelihood that they may exist.
