This paper strip is designed to detect diseases including
cancer and malaria for a cost of 50 cents per strip. It was
created as a way to get cheap malaria diagnoses into
the hands of people in rural Africa and southeast Asia,
where the disease kills hundreds of thousands of
people and infects hundreds of millions every year. You
apply a drop of blood to the paper at home and mail it
to a laboratory on a regular basis--and see a doctor
only if the test comes out positive.
