Researchers have developed regenerative dental
fillings that allow teeth to heal themselves. The fillings
are made of therapeutic synthetic, light-curable,
biomaterials that support native dental stem cells
inside teeth to repair and regenerate dentin.
Stem-cell-based dental filling could someday
eliminate the need for root canal procedure.
