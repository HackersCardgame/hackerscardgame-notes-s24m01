Conservatives

I'm Voting for candidate A because he uses the word God
in his campaign speeches more than the other guy!

And I'm voting for candidate B because he doesn't
use the word God quite as often as candidate Al

Conservatives and liberals

But sir, candidate A's tax plan is actually worse for
someone in your income bracket. And you sir:
candidate B's policies about economic reform could
hurt a small business owner like yourself.

Abortion! The environment!
Monster trucks! Hybrid cars!
