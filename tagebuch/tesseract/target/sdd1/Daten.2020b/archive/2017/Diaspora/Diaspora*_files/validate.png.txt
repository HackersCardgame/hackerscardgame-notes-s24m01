Do you validate your beliefs by
constantly trying to convince

others to believe the same thing?

Ugh. Mormons again.

This is why I'm a fan of Buddhists and Jews.
There's no such thing as a door-to-door Jew

Their attitude is more like
“Tm Jewish and this shit is awesome.
T don't give a raging crap if you're joining
or not. In fact, you're not allowed in.
All this awesome shit is mine.”

Hey, he looks troubled! Stop running, sir.
GET HIM ABRAHAM DIED FOR YOUR

LOX AND MATZAH BALLS!
