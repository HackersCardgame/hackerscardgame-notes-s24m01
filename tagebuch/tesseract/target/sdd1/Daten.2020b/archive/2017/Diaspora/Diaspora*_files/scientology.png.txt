Do you mock other religions
for believing crazy things ...

Haha! So it says here that Scientologists believe the souls of
aliens were brought here by a galactic lord named *Xenu.”

Apparently he flew the frozen bodies
of these aliens here on interstellar

cruisers and dropped them into
Volcanoes. The souls of these aliens

now float around and pollute our
souls with fear, doubt and suffering

Haha, that’s INSANE!
Tom Cruise is INSANE!

Totally!

Meanwhile believing some
crazy shit of your own?

Everyone knows what REALLY happened is an omnipotent
father figure BUILT outer space and then put a garden on

earth where a naked couple ate some fruit which was bad
and then he had magic no-touchy sex with a virgin who gave
birth to this bearded hippy guy who got killed until he came
back to life as a Zombie where he floats around teaching us
all not to masturbate too much or we'll be sent to the
earth's core and barbequed for all eternity!

T know, right!
Those crazy
scientologists have
it all wrong!
