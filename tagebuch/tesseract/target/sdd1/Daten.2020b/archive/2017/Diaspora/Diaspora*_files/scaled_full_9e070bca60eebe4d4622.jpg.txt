You want me to look up to you...?

You fail the innocent, fail the poor, the hungry
the oppressed. You talk of success while security fades away,
fuel hatred and break the back of hope

I cannot look up to something that has sunksolow |
but when my hands are your size | will seize what is
needed to change this world for the good of us all

not the want of you
