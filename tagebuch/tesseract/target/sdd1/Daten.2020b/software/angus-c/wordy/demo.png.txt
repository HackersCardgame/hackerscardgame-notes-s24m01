GLOUCESTER (079%)

Now is the winter of our discontent (063%)
‘Made glorious summer by this sun of York; (0.80%)
‘And all the clouds that lour’d upon our house (0.80%)
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. (0.50%)
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stem alarums changed to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures
Grim-visaced war hath semooth'd his wrinkled front:

Enter GLOUCESTER, solus
