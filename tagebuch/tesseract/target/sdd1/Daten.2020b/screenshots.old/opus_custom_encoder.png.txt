Opus Custom

‘Opus Custom is an optional part of the Opus specification and reference implementation which uses a distinct API from the regular API and supports frame sizes that are not normally supported. Use of Opus Custom is for all but very special applications for which a frame size different from 2.5, 5, 10, or 20 ms is

needed (for either complexity or latency reasons) and where interoperability is less important. More.
