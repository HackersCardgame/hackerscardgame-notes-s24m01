There are several (most not working) ways they try
to format the brain of WhiteHats. cl, c2, al6, dtl,
m22, m27, m41, m44, ma5, m15, t10, co4, m42, but
definitley m19.

if you would think of the drawing as of a visual
representation of the content in your brain and the
purple part they want to overwrite. Unfortunately
brain is not two dimensional, so this would maybe
succeed for a while but, and "â€œanti"psychotics just
help to keep the victim silent, but in the end it's not
really deleted. That's where the 1960s People have
great opportunities for long-term jobs, but after a
while this "maybe" is failing too...
