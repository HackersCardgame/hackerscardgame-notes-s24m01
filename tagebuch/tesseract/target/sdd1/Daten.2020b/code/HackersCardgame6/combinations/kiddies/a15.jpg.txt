If you need to punish someone then do it bijective.
Best thing is not to attack a person physically or in
the mainframe, or with cyberwar... you could risk his
or your life. There are seldom cases, for example if
they want to (cyber-)rape your girl..., in this case it is
possibly ok to defend yourself and younger against
the offender. Keep in mind that you defend yourself
without causing permenent harm. Maybe the
offender is remote controlled. See cards t1,... t*

If there is something like death sentence for
example in texas then and would kill an innocent
you would find that out to late, then the whole could
state is sentenced to death to. In Switzerland there
are no official dead sentences.
