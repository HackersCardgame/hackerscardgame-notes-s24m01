Inventor:
My definition of a Mental Operating System would be
a . See
mos3 card. For example one could render down
significant simpsons scenes on a
to 200x150 pixel and use this scenes on eg t1, t10,
t12, t* cards to influence the 1980s generation to do
things the right way. For example when

and lisa helps bart to get his soul back. Since
Matthew ,,Matt“ Abram Groening seems to be
one of the good guys it would be hard for the mos3
card people to abuse the mos1 card. Hopefully those
scenes are covered by normaly broadcasting fees in
switzerland, abut anyway see  co4-— card.
