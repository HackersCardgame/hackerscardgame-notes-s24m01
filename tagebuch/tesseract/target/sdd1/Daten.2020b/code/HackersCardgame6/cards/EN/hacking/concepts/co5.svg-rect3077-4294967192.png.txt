There are several (most non working) methods they try to
format the brain of WhiteHats / Whistleblowers. cl, c2,
al6, dtl, m22, m27, m41, m44, ma5, m15, t10, co4,
m42, but definitley m19. Maybe deleting the scenes of a
rape would help the victim, maybe.

Think of the drawing as a visual representation of the
contents in your brain and the purple part is what they
want to overwrite. Unfortunately brain is not two
dimensional, so this would maybe work for a while but,
and “anti"psychotics may "help" to keep the victim silent,
but in the end nothing is really deleted. That's where the
1960s People have great long-term job opportunities for
in the survaillance business payed by the perpetrator, but
after a while this "maybe" fails too... https://
