Some Mental Institutions give young adults or
even kids drugs that make them stupid and
happy. (Part 1) And with technology Cards (eg
tl or 70 years newer technology) they then
(ab)use them to infiltrate dangerous systems
(Part 2), for example companies that are
using or selling illegl drugs. The
"antipsychotics" makes the kid stupid, Lucky
ignorant and would cause the kid to make fun
about the people in question. So the company
or chief in question would tend to hate and
attack the young adult. See Human Rights, see
Law.
