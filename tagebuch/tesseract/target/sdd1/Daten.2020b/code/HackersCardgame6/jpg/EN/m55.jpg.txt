With tons of bigdata you could easily say if someone is
lying. Maybe there is already a system that does that
function this to help parents to teach their children well.
This would need some Algorithms and some Technology
cards and of course some programming langauge like
Prolog. After a while the parents would trust into this
stimuli and if the oldes kid would say, the system is lying
but the stimulus that was trained in the parents head
says this is a lie, the system does not lie, the parents
would not believe that the system is broken or that the
system is intentionally lying. Maybe a common problem
among WhiteHat Hackers. But it bacame easier since
good people like Manning or Snowden provided us with
proov. What if Schizophrenic People have the same
Problem, or at least some of them. Workarund: switch
from Inductive reasoning to Deductive reasoning
