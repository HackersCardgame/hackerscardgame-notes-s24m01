Groups of old pedophile looking (german: glupschen) (Wo)men
that seems to know my positional data, even if you have no
electronic device on me. Maybe RFID in the Creditcard /
Surveillance Cam of Shopping-Mall. They seem to enjoy to
hassle you, more worse if you have epilated your thing
between the legs day before. They target your sexual integrity,
because one epilated / shaved "maybe" for an equal aged, not
for old pedophile zobies. Possibly they get broadcast message
"fressmeet at <your positional data>" "Human"-BOTs seem to
be driven by their limbic system. The fact that they know what
you did privately drives me insane. For me as a 40 year old
Man it's quite annoying, but imaging how this must be for a 20
year young women. That makes you behave paranoid and
insane (->m19)? Behavioral Science & Marketing young to old /
old to young (m7,m8 card) We should add Automatic
Behavior Recognition Sociopsychology-Designpattern at
least for the young giris so that they are not thrown in the
group of old staring pedophiles, but in the group of equal aged.
