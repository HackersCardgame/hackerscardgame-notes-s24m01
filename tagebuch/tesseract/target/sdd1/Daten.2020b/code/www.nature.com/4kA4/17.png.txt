Mean squared error on game outcome predictions for neural networks trained by reinforcement learning (that is, AlphaGo Zero) or supervised learning, For supervised
learning, the network was trained for 3 days on KGS data (amateur games); comparative results are also shown from ref. 12. For reinforcement learning, the 20 block
network was trained for 3 days and the 40 block network was trained for 40 days, Networks were also evaluated on a validation set based on professional games from
the GoKifu dataset.
