Inventor:

Guiltless been thrown out of the University, then
they put Marcjr in a Pottery course, which was sold
as a "good" lesson to correct his (non-existent)
arrogance, de facto it was psychological warfare to
break(point) Marc Jr with pointless works: "go, do a
bit of crafting you looser" = revictimizing of his
childhood. 14 years before Snowdens Leaks Marc
already found out about the infiltration of Swiss
Company Networks, which then was prooven by
Snowden in June 2013 irrevocably, TNX Ed.
Technically the Network could be secured, but the
Network installed also malware and backdoors in the
psyche of relevant People like politicians, Shrinks,
Computer Scientists, Science People. To fix that too
will cause tears, therefor never forget the a1l5 Card
