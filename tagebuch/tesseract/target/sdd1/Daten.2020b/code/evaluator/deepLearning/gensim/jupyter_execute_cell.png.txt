Corpus Markdown Cell (text)

A corpus is a collection of digital documents. This collection is the input to gensim from which it
will infer the structure of the documents, their topics, etc. The latent structure inferred from the
corpus can later be used to assign topics to new documents which were not present in the training
corpus. For this reason, we also refer to this collection as the training corpus. No human
intervention (such as tagging the documents by hand) is required - the topic classification is
unsupervised.

For our corpus, we'lluse a lst of 9 strings, each consisting of only asingle sentence. 4414 Cel
