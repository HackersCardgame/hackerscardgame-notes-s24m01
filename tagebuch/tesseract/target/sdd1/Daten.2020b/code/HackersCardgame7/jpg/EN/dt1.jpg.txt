YOU KILLED!
PSY-ERCKOOOR

Inventor: :
If you would have something like Neuralink or US4877027
and Windows tells you,

, Or mouse gestures "

" [dx/dt | dy/dt] then a chinese person you not know
will aS You ea il wows not do amis; But if soneone adds,
"this should te ossible" and is illegal,
you would need to test that to heee that nobody else goes
into this trap. Maybe you really killed someone. Since you
don't know this person (german: kein Motiv) and Windows
was sold as kids-toy not as Weapon you are maybe just the
scapegoat. Maybe people killed Muslims on Windows so the
"Colateral Murder" Video would revictimize 16Mio People for
drawing this damn V on Windows (m50 card). Unknown
