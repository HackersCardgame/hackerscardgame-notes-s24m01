They seem to have some sort of function on Stimoceiver,
Neuralink to detect if you try to find something.

That activates an eventtrigger that then samples the
person you fear most (Pfisterer) say things like:

- Suchen bis gefunden (.mil Retohrical Automatism)

- HAHAHA, i hold it in my hand (+video Sample)

- What does he want, HAHAHA

(additional b1 card is activated with the sample)

Especially annoying when they do it if you try to find your
sex toys... prerequisite maybe m98 card, often plays loop
that makes you search always the same places triggers
multiple times, co2->al16 In my particular case they seem
to have a fetish triggering that in private life, maybe they
hope, i would not leak it then... as you see, i would "not",
and if you talk about that they even begin to render things
on your sex toys, that suxx even more
