john McStain

Was once viewed as a war hero, but we don't
like heroes that get caught (doing evil things). A
B] very badguy nowadays, took advantage of, and
deceived the American people. Named after
true American Patriots, his father and
grandfather, he has stained his family name.
His name now is... McStain.
