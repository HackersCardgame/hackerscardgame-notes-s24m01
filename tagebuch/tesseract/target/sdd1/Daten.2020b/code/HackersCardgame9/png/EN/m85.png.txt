| guess there is some sort of electronic red pen where the
offender can change things in text | wrote. The principle is
quite simple, For example writing *TERROR* all over the text
and then additionally activating an Active Denial System /
Amygdala, one would not be able to read what the person who
wrote the original text would like to say. Not tested so far.
Workaround would be to use color your own in the text you
write, it then would still be possible, but much harder for those
that uses this dirty trick.

Technically one could implement that with things like tl card,
or if you would know how many words a person reads per
second you would for example send the word you would mark
with a high frequency sound just above auditory threshold...
Maybe this technology was one invented for good, to help
children in grammar or ortography, bad people possibly use it
for the contrary effect or to make important texts like
protocols in criminal cases unreadable.
