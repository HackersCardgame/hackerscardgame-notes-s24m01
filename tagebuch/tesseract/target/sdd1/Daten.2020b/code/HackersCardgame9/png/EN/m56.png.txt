Often the offenders try to intimidate the victim(s). There are
may ways they do that, with weapons (m21) with law (co4)
with threads against the people i love, with poison
(eventtrigger on eg. the drink you just had and a loop: "You've
just been poisoned, hahaha"), or they tell you "we will put
you again in a mental institution where they force you to take
drugs that even kill, eg Zyprexa. Often they additionally use
the role toggler card (m42) and tell the victim, that he is
intimidating the offenders to keep the victim and others busy
and confused. (fr-036, the thing that shoots every second)
Normally they activate multiple systems to generate difusion
and to protect the single systems of criminals: mental
institutions, law system, local people that hacks the victims
computer, but also not all (see al2 Card) Most of the time it's
just psychological warfare but i am careful because i more or
less know how they killed Tobias Moser (m46 card)
