Young people play games for fun, for having a
meeting with friends over Teamspeak/Mumble
(maybe mainly to discuss about Computer Science
Stuff)

But there are also situations where the game or
additional software tells them that if they win the
game they would win things like women, money,
degree... this wishes then maybe never become true

Later the people who added these features would
tell that because of this headshot or nemesis pin
with knife a real person died (dtl card) so better
focus on the Computer Science stuff.
