"He Hears non-existent voices, hahaha", invisible
communication channels, pulsed microwaves received
directly by the cochlea. The exact frequence found by
scanning through the possible frequencies, if the victim
puts his mane to his ear ("tinnitus"); Automatic Behavior
Recognition. Was 30 Years not patented until 1989 aR
US4877027. 7, Techaidally it would have been possible to do
this ane already with electron tubes (~ 1900).
Psychological Perspective: people that abuse such
technology would keep that secret and previously labeled
as a "Schizophrenic" the victim is completely defenseless
and it is likely they induced suicide or amok. In
combination with e.g. a loop recorder, see also co2 Card,
the perpetrators often caused permanent damage in the
