In videos you will hear often "project paperclip" but seldom a
detailed explanation, "Project Paperclip" definitely would be a
honey pot or a database trigger, so be careful if you google
it. Wikipedia talks about 2200 German Science Specialists
and it talks about eg. about V2 Rockets (that is a strong
image and maybe supposed to induces fear). We guess that
those 2200 Scientists built some sort of Mainframe with a
virtual model of the world in 3D or at least from the civilized
world. There people can add eventtriggers (t14), or use
Cyber-[fluorescent|red]-Pen (m84,m85) to manipulate the
masses. To stick things to documents like people do with
paperclips, easy to understand, no explanation needed, and
the users that use it are then used to target for example
whistleblowers that would like to expose that system.

vulnerability is insecure to those who know about the
vulnerability..." (Psychological Warfare & HoneyPot Kids)
