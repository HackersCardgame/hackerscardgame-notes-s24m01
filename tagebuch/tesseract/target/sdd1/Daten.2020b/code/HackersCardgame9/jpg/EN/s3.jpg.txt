A laurel wreath is a wreath made of branches and
leaves of the laurel (latin laurus). The laurel wreath
is a symbol and an insignia for a special honor or
distinction, for a victory (eg. for killing sheeps or
even innocent children) or a special success. So to
say the special super-duper superman hero

To compensate low self-esteem (object fixation) with

as using always the one and the same One-Time-
Pad.
