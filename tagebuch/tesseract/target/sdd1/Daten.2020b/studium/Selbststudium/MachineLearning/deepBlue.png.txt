Deep Blue versus Kasparov [eait)

Main article: Deep Blue versus Garry Kasparov
Deep Blue and Kasparov played each other on two occasions. The first match began on 10 February 1996, in which Deep Blue became the first machine to win a chess game against a reigning world champion (Garry Kasparov) under regular time controls. However,
Kasparov won three and drew two of the following five games, beating Deep Blue by a score of 4~2 (wins count 1 point, draws count ¥2 point). The match concluded on 17 February 1996.

Deep Blue was then heavily upgraded (unofficially nicknamed "Deeper Blue")!!5) and played Kasparov again in May 1997, winning the six-game rematch 3¥2-2¥, ending on 11 May. Deep Blue won the deciding game six after Kasparov made a mistake in the opening,
becoming the first computer system to defeat a reigning world champion in a match under standard chess tournament time controls.

The system derived its playing strength mainly from brute force computing power. It was a massively parallel, RS/6000 SP Thin P2SC-based system with 30 nodes, with each node containing a 120 MHz P2SC microprocessor, enhanced with 480 special purpose VLSI
chess chips. Its chess playing program was written in C and ran under the AIX operating system. It was capable of evaluating 200 million positions per second, twice as fast as the 1996 version. In June 1997, Deep Blue was the 259th most powerful supercomputer
according to the TOP500 list, achieving S938IGFLOPS on the High-Performance LINPACK benchmark.!®1

The Deep Blue chess computer that defeated Kasparov in 1997 would typically search to a depth of between six and eight moves to a maximum of twenty or even more moves in some situations.!271 David Levy and Monty Newborn estimate that one additional ply (half-
move) increases the playing strength 50 to 70 Elo points.!18l

Deep Blue's evaluation function was initially written in a generalized form, with many to-be-determined parameters (e.g. how important is a safe king position compared to a space advantage in the center, etc.). The optimal values for these parameters were then
determined by the system itself, by analyzing thousands of master games. The evaluation function had been split into 8,000 parts, many of them designed for special positions. in the opening book there were over 4,000 positions and 700,000 grandmaster games. The
endgame database contained many six piece endgames and five or fewer piece positions. Before the second match, the chess knowledge of the program was fine tuned by grandmaster Joel Benjamin. The opening library was provided by grandmasters Miguel illescas,
John Fedorowicz, and Nick de Firmian.'1°! when Kasparov requested that he be allowed to study other games that Deep Blue had played so as to better understand his opponent, IBM refused. However, Kasparov did study many popular PC games to become familiar with
computer game play in general. {ton needed

Writer Nate Silver suggests that a bug in Deep Blue's software led to a seemingly random move (the 44th in the first game of the second match) which Kasparov misattributed to "superior intelligence” 2°24) subsequently, Kasparov experienced a drop in performance due
to anxiety in the following game.24)
