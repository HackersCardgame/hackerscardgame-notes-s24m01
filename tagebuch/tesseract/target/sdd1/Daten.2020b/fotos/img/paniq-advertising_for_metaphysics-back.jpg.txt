‘Thanks a lot to everybody wo has supported or influenced me in the past, in artistic or
other ways. Since | am an entity that basically does not produce but feed back infor-
‘mation, this album is also the work of a lot of people | met and talked to, of books that |
have read and therefore the work of philosophers and other troublemakers, the work

Cf my mother, the work of nature and the work of the time in which this album has been
created.

Feedback is not a one-way-thing, It goes on and on. So all | wish is that (if you liked this
‘alum ) you write me and tell me what you think of it, or what you thought while you
were listening to it. Nothing is more painful than shouting into the void and getting no
response.
