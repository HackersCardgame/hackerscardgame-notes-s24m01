GEOSTAMP: More Fun from Ferguson

by Dick Estel

Did you ever hike to play with those rubber
stamp sets 96 2 Kid? You could print your own
newsletter (primitive Desk Top Publishing), make
pictures of Ml kinds, and get ink all over your
hands,

‘GE0S programmer David B. Ferguson has taken
the rubber stamp concept and applied it to the
computer with = program called geoStamp. The
program works successfully only within geoPaint,
fand allows you ta capture or create @ small image,
and then quickly and easily repeat it anywhere on
the page

This type of thing can be done within the
frawing window by use of the edit feature,
futlining an image and then copying. To transfer it
to an area of the page outside the window, it must
be seved a3 a photo sorap, and pasted in the
desired nev lecation

‘lust how daes_geaSterp improve on this
ability? First, geoStemp is reafly a set. of
programs: geoStamp itself, which works as 8 desk
accessory; Stamp Collect,” also a DA which allows
you to grab an existing image from geoPaint, and
Stamp Edit, which is used to create new stamps or
change existing anes

‘The program creates data files called stamp
lous, each of which can held up to 30 images,
When any of the geoStamp programs are opened,
you are prompted to open or create an album. This
allows building up files of related images. There
are several stamp sets available on O-Link, and
several are included with the program, including
cartoon characters

| have found one of geoStamp's most useful
features is in creating borders. There are many
fancy small borders, and | have tediously made
them into Terge borders by copying. and_ pasting
photo seraps, Getting the ite curticues or
‘whatever to tine up when blindly pasting 9 photo
sorap is «mind boggling and sometimes virtually
‘impossible task

‘hen using geoStamp, the image to be stamped
fs visible as you move it around the screen. This
allows over lapping parts tobe lined up perfectly.

RUBBER RINGMASTER

Long ago I had a set of circus animal rubber
stamps. The instructions that came with it
suggested 9. way to print out pictures of animals
standing side by side, You could stemp one
elephant picture on a piece of scrap paper and cut
‘tout Then you could stemp another ane on your
‘good’ paper, overlay the cutout, and. stomp.

second one would appear to be behind the first, since the parts of the
‘mage that went anto the mask would net appear ‘on the finished rt

Using the "cookie cutter” option of geoStamp, I was able to recreate
this technique on the computer. The cookie cutter feature actualy
reverses any area touched by. pixel in the stamp image (good for
making neat. white on black pictures too). To. make my. tine of
elephants, | had to create two identical stamps, one of them reversed
Then | used the cookie cutter option to eliminate all pixels in the offset
image area, switched to the black en white image, and stamped it in the
exect spot. This required changing images witheut moving the mouse,
something | found was quite easy todo,

Many of the controts in geoStamp are via keyboard, since the pointer
fs busy placing the picture. The codes can be viewed any time by
pressing H for Help. The numerals 1 and 2 move forward and backward
between piotures. This allowed me to hold the mause pointer still while
changing pictures for _my elephant parade. The current stamp is
lisplayed in the Tower right in all geoStamp modules.

“Ta be honest, Ihave not found a lot of uses for geoStamp, but its @
fun program (| believe even productivity programs should be fun most
of the time). You could use it to create interesting tile pattern
btfects, inching reverse images. If you were creating artwork with
many repetitive images, it would be easter in most cases to use
geoStemp than the standard out and paste method,

| asked Dave to comment on other possible uses for geoStamp:. “One
of the things | really wanted to use it for was doing building design,
kind of Tike the part of CAD where you can place figures anywhere you
‘want. | am currently working on a set of home design stamps, but i is
4 slow process,

‘GeeStamnp has some limitations which | hope David will evercome in @
future upgrade. would Tike to see the ability to have larger
stamps.the stamp size is slightly smaller than 8 Print Shop image. The
elephant stamp is actuaTly made of four separate stamps, one for esch
‘quarter of the piture

However, Im glad this program exists.its fun to play with, and you
ont get ink’ on your hands!
