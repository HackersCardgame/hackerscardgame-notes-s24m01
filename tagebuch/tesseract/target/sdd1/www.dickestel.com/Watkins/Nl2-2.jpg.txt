OTHER HAPPENINGS

Christmas time, 1990 was the time of the big freeze in
central California, The area usually enjoys mild
temperatures in the winter, with only oocasional freezing
temperatures, usually above 28. Fresno CA set some
ecards with lows of 16 to 22 for several days, In edition
0-8 major loss of the San Joaquin Yaley citrus crop,
hundreds of people had the unpleasant and surprising
experience of broken water pipes and flooded homes.

‘rnong those affected were Bob and Hazel Este, whose
sierra foothill home in Mariposa CA had to have the walls
and ceilings in all three bedraams replaced. The incoming
‘water Tine to a rooftop solar water heater broke while they
‘were spending Christmas with family in Fresno. Although
insurance coverage took care of most of the cost, they had
te virtualy mave into their motor home for a week ar 30,
and were forced to delay a planned trip to arizona. Those
of our family whe remain in the colder part of the country
are used to such low temperatures and precautions are a
matter of course--but this was completely unexpected for
Californians
