MERRILL SAWMILL

DESTROYED

BY FIRE

The Merrill sawmill, one of the
long established and largest mills
in the county, was completely de-
stroyed by, fire last Thursday eve-
ning.

In addition to the well equipped
mill itself, thousands of board feet
of newly-sawed lumber were de-
stroyed as well as thousands of feet
of logs awaiting the sawyer the fol-
lowing day.

Whether or not the mill will be
rebuilt is unknown at this time.
Cause of the halocaust remains un-
known. Workmen said it started in
the mill and at the time the fire
started they heard a tremendous ex-

| plosion. The mill was owned by
Roy Merrill.

Loss of the mill ended employ-
ment for at least 30 men in this
area.

Mill workers, residents in the area
and forest service fire fighters
battled the blaze for several hours.
The state division of forestry fire
fighters from Mariposa were unable
to participate due to the fact they.

.| were fighting another blaze at the

time.
