Next Thing to
Perpetual Motion
At Sawmills Here

The Merrill and Johnson sawmills
in Mariposa county have perfected
the next thing to perpetual motion
at their mills, in utilizing the et
dust to make power to cut the tim-
ber.

The sawdust from a, log being
sawed is conveyed to a higher ele-
vation and shot down the slope into
a-fiirnace to create the steam to
work the machinery, the sawdust
from the log cut being  suffi-
cient to complete the cycle. |

This method is under close con-
trol, being banked at night and
‘opened in the morning ready to go.
‘It also represents quite a saving in

‘manpower and expense.
