\WHITTLING AND WOODCARYING

| remember sitting by the monkey cage at the Aliance zoo and
â€˜watching a guy whittling on a chunk of two by four. t took him
bout fo hours to carve it down into cage with three balls
locked inside. Ive tried whittling away Montana nights. Turned
tout a double-ended weoden spoon and made the bandaid people
thirty cents richer. Should've read the book

id from The Last Whole Earth Catalog, lauding Eu.
