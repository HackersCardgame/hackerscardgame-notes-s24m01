If you would have some "unseen" communication
channel like US4877027 or Stimoceiver or Neuralink
and something happens like your face suddenly gets
burned (see m121 Card) then there are many reasons
given why this happened or how this happened.
Often only junk and spam that would lead you into
the wrong direction. Take a pencil and paper and note
all of them down, some of them you can elmininate
because there are mistakes in that reason. some you
can not, but if you note all the clames and then it
would be easy to find the pivot element
($1940sShrink&$herFather) since people tend to use
often the same chess pieces and moves.
