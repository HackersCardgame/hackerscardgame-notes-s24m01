On the mainframe there are many software modules that
warn people from risking their lives or their health.
Unfortunately some people wrote a generic algorithm,
that rewrites things like "don't touch that" to "touch it
now, touch it fast" or "stop here" to "continue fast". So
people would get hurt by the security software that
should prevent that they get hurt. The same thin like
someone would stick a "good medicine" sticker over a
biohazard sticker. We should add additional algorithms
that prevent such modifications. Possibly it is also just a
second system that evaluates the "WARNING" message
and then takes over the Human-BOTs, Stimoceiver,
Neuralink ... after one found such a malware they often
sell it as feature to train students, not considering what
such a malware could cause harm or even kill innocent
kids
