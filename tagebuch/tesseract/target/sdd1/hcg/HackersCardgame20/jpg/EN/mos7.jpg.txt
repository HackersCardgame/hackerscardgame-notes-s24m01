This book seems to be suggested to people in Aarau, that had
grandmothers in Aarau Gonhard as soon as they were the first
time in the mental institution Konigsfelden.

It talks about "magical crystals" like in the gemac Zak Mc
Cracken. Talks about John von Neumann as the guy that remote
controlled the mind of people with electronics, but not
mentioning neuro-chirurgial doctors that would be required to
add an interface to the brain like neuralink. It explicitely talks
not about possible technology like stimoceiver or us4877027.

There are also scenes about women, goddess what could imply
that that one of the triggers to control and dissociate the first
love like the situation with $onlyGirlfriend drove me to many
suicide attempts and the possible rape of the father of the so
called "#Grosimorder" girlfriend to drive him to murder his
grandmother and i bet the house of the grandmother was
inherited to the father of the "Grosimorder"
