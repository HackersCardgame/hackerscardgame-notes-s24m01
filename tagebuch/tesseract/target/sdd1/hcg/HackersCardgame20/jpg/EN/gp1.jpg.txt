Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries

Without them humanity cannot survive.”
-Dalai Lama

Inventor:

, of more some few people in big
systems like the or
mostly older people tend to separate society eg.
left-wing from right-wing or christianity from islam
from judaism, white from black, ... they try to make
them fight each other while those who made them
fight take their goods. Maybe we should warn the
younger people with the message: COEXIST. As a
christian for example learned a lot from Islamic or
jewish culture. Notice: for many people today
science or atheism is also some sort of religion
even if it's called atheism. Those people

would maybe want to distroy this

card so that they can play on thier dirthy game. |
please all religions to distribute and protect this
sort of COEXIST cards. This Card would help to
mitigate the "Divide Et Impera" on the flags of
some StudentAssociacions...
