As a kid | pirated lot of Software / Music / Movies. So they
blackmailed me with that sin until i relicensed everything. As
far as i know i relicensed "Monkey Island 1" and/or Doom1
about three times. After they could not blackmail me anymore
with piracy they begun to blackmail me with things that go
against my sexual integrity or they used scenes like "you've
just been poisoned" or "you've just been raped under
hypnosis" after all, i should not have relicensed all, because
you maybe feel bad about things you "stole" or copied, but
the other things drove me into hundreds of suicide attempts.
Additionally if you have proof for real crime or even murderer
and the accused would use this NSA/CIA dataset to blackmail
you, as long as you dissociate because of your piracy sins he
will dissociate you but not kill you, unfortunately i relicensed
almost everything. But one good thing in relicensing things
you pirated eg with 6 Years is, that the records maybe help to
remember childhood scenes
