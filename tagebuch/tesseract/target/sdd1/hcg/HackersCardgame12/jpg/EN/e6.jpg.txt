Equation Group malware or even Built-In is a
customized firmware for Harddrives and
SolidStateDrives. They publicly said that it is "just"
some malware to reinfect your computer after you
reinstalled your operating system. In my humble
opionion it has also some remote interface like the
eyefi SD Card has, technicall some sort of AX.25
interface (up to 8 Miles) but way more modern. And
one of those things the seed to the public and those
people that ask questions, tweet to the Hashtag
#EquationGroup would end up the 11th time ina
Mental Institution. (see m138, m124 Card) Further
research required...
