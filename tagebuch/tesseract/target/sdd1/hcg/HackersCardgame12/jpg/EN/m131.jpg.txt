Inventor:

We guess the NSA/CIA works with the principle of

seduction. He gives the people the opportunity to get

money if they sell their soul, or if they sell their soul

just a little bit. With and 100 Years of

DataRetention

. Thy used m66 Card as Scapegoat.

One working hack to work around this principle is to

confess what you have done. Me for example | drove

drunken car and did other things, so i tried to turn

myself in, but they said that this sins were expired.

From that point in time the NSA/CIA System couldn't

blackmail me with this sins anymore, unfortunately

they then begun to shoot against my sexual integrity.
Nun not included in all use

cases.
