‘Schwarzenbach was born in Ruschlikon to a Protestant industrialist family and went on to develop publishing industries. He converted to Roman Catholicism
while at university, in 1933.1

In 1934, as a student, Schwarzenbach orchestrated a public uproar by his fellow members of the pro-Nazi movement National Front when the anti-fascist
cabaret group "Die Pfeffermuhle’, in exile from Germany, was touring in Switzerland. In Zurich the cabaret, led by Therese Giehse, Erika Mann, and Klaus
Mann, was only able to perform under police protection. James Schwarzenbach's aunt Renée Schwarzenbach-Wille was suspected to be the power behind
the turmoil. She accused Erika Mann to have set up her daughter, the writer Annemarie Schwarzenbach who was a close friend of the Mann family, against
her own family

In 1939, at the age of 28, Schwarzenbach eared his doctorate in history at the University of Zurich. The subject of his thesis was the neutrality policy of
Switzerland.

‘Schwarzenbach was a member of the Swiss National Council representing the National Action in the legislature between 1967 and 1971. Schwarzenbach's
Republican Movement originated as a split of National Action in 1971, and it lasted unti its dissolution in 1989.

SEMMEESREEEMIs chiefly known for his [filitive on Ubertremdung (“excess of foreigners") that was put to the vote in June 1970. The referendum had a
record turnout (75%), with 45% of the votes supporting Schwarzenbach's proposal. The proposal, if accepted, would have meant that the Swiss government
had to limit foreign workers to Switzerland to 10%, which then would mean the deportation of up to 300,000 foreigners over 4 years. Although not enacted, the
referendum did cause the number of available work-permits to be lowered.!°) Xenophobia in Switzerland at the time was chiefly directed against Italian migrant
workers, whose number had increased from 300,000 to over 1 million during the economic surge after World War II between 1950 and 1970.

‘Xenophobia decreased in the later 1970s as with slackening economy nearly as many migrant workers as had been targeted by the Schwarzenbach [tive
lost their jobs and left Switzerland, raising its head again in the mid-1990s, this time targeting Aus/anderkriminalitat ("foreigner delinquency"). In this period, the
xenophobic sentiment was addressed by populist propaganda of the Swiss People's Party (SVP), with Schwarzenbach's erstwhile secretary Ulrich Schlder
pursuing his former employer's politics within the ranks of the SVP.

In his later years, Schwarzenbach also voiced opposition against the EFTA, or the EU common market, as well as international institutions like the UN.[31

James Schwarzenbach who was also a writer of regional novels died at 83 in St. Moritz.
