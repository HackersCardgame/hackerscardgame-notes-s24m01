rymdlego i realize Lyrics

If could gather all the stars
and hold them in my hand,
the colors | would then possess
would not be half as grand
as those which | have seen
when | look deep into your eyes,
or come across
when I have kissed your lips, | realize.

If could ponder all the truths
men sought since time began,
they would not teach me more than if
Iwere to touch your hand
For truth to no one you have touched
appear as simple lies,

And nothing could be truer
than your touch, | realize.

If were given lasting life
as only God could do,
I'd shun it all and turn away,
if | could live with you.
For even God has never known
the immesurable size
Of the love that's
within your heart, | realize.
[Kim Ault, 1997]
