Fill device

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Ail device or key loader is a module used to load cryptographic keys into electronic encryption machines. Fill devices are usually hand held and electronic
‘ones are battery operated,

(Older mechanical encryption systems, such as rotor machines, were keyed by setting the positions of wheels and plugs from a printed keying list. Electronic
‘systems required some way to load the necessary cryptovatiable data. In the 1950s and 1960s, systems such as the U.S. National Security Agency KW.26
‘and the Soviet Union's Fialka used punched cards for this purpose. Later NSA encryption systems incorporated a serial port fll connector and developed
‘several common fill devices (CFDs) that could be used with multiple systems. A CFD was plugged in when new keys were to be loaded. Newer NSA systems
allow “over the air rekeying® (OTAR), but a master key often must stil be loaded using a fl device.

NSA uses two serial protocots for key fl, BS-101 and DS-102, Both employ the same U-228 6-pin connector type Used for U.S. miltary audio handsets, wih 87 vo

the DS-101 being the newer of the two serial fil protocols. The DS-101 protocol can also be used to load cryptographic algorithms and software updates for
crypto modules.

Besides encryption devices, systems that can require key fill nclude IFF, GPS and frequency hopping radios such as Have Quick and SINCGARS.

‘Common fil devices employed by NSA include:

‘+ KYK-28 pin gun used with the NESTOR (encryption) system

+ KYK-13 Electronic Transfer Device

‘+ KYX-15 Net Control Devicel’l

‘+ MX-10579 ECCM Fill Device (SINCGARS)#)

‘+ KOI-18 paper tape reader. The operator pulls 8-level tape through this unit by hand. AKYK-13 fill device.

‘+ ANICYZ-10 Data Transfer Device - a small PDA-lke unit that can store up to 1000 keys.

‘+ Secure DTD2000 System (SDS) - Named KIK.20, this was the next generation common fill device replacement for the DTD when it started production in 2006. It employs the Windows CE
operating system!

‘+ ANIPYQ-10 Simple Key Loader (SKL) - a simpler replacement for the DTD.

‘+ KSD-64 Crypto ignition key (CIK)
