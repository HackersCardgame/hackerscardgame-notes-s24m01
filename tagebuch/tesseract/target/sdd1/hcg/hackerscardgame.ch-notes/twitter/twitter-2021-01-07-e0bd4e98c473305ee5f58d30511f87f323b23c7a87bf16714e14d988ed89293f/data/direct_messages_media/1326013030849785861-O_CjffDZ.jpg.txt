Protect younger people [edit]

one important thing is missing in Hacker Ethics, whatever you do, always protect younger people, no matter what religion, no matter what race, no matter what
skin color, no matter if right wing, middle wing or right wing, you can't hardly do something wrong, if you protect younger people, and it would also be a
mindset that would find global acceptance and would lead to global coexistence. And protecting does not mean, that you later are allowed to take their goods
or their virginity, just because you helped. If you live that Categorical Imperative in an altruistic way it would give you meaing in your live. 178.82.215.219 (talk)
