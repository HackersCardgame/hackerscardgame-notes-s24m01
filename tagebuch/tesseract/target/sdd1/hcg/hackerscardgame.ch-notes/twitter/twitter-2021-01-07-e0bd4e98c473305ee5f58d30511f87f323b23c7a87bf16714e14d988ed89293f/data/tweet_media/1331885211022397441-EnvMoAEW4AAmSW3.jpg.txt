Swiss Army has dishes to send data rather slow if
you read the specs over discance up to 50 miles.
They use the band around 15GHz (A = 20mm).
Equipment to measure such high frequencies you
need a device that costs ~20'000 sFR. Out of reach
for many poor people in Switzerland. As soon as
one would have an implant or only a golden wire of
the length of A/n the energy would maybe
sufficient to induce 50mvV that would stimulate eg.
the brain. If the implant is in the amygdala (b1
card) it would possibly induce rage. WARNING: if
true, you don't want to be the guy that found
that out. With similar technology it would be quite
easy to even force good judges to eg. extradite
