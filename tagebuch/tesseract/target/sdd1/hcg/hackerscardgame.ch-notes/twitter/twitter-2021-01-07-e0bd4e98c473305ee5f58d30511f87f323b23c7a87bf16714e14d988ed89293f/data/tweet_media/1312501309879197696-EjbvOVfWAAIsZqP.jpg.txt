Since the Roswell-Incident, the CIA possibly tried to
keep illegal Human Experiments secret and told the
people and victims that such incidents were Aliens
"attacks". Those who found out tried to find a way to
protect themselves are thrown out of the society.
Because tin foil would possibly block things like the
Stimoceiver Implants, they started to discredit this
archetype in Media as a Crazy Person. Not sure if tin
foil helped at all, possibly depends on frequencies
and transmitting power. We should pay some tensor-
magicians or better enslave them to calculate this
for us for free.

without tin foil: Henry Starling in Star Trek Voyager
