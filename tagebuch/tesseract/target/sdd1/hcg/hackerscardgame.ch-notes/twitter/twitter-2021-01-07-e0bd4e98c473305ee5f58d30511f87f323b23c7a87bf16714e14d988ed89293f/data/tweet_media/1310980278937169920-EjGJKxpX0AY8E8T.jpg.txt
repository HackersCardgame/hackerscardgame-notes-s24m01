In information security, computer science, and other fields, the principle of least privilege (PoLP), also known as the
principle of minimal privilege or the principle of least authority, requires that in a particular abstraction layer of a
computing environment, every module (such as a process, a user, or a program, depending on the subject) must be able

to access only the information and resources that are necessary for its legitimate purpose. !"II2]
