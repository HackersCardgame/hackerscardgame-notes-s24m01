Many Social Systems have a Gypsy Cemetery. Initially
there would be "only" one dead kid, gypsy... Maybe the
one, that was just ignored or forgot by the group. Some
older people use things like the m37 card and tell the
group to judge the equal aged, then using dt1 crad. Even
if group said no to m37, and if someone from the older
generation pushed that red button the group would still
feel bad. An additional problem would be that the olders
selects the next scapegoat "to protect the group". The
falsely accused equal aged would problably find out
about that dirthy "game". So you would have a
transitive (math) situation where all the older people
would have to attack the youngest asking [ the right |
to many ] questions. It seems that if you ask the right
questions that the aledged murderer plays multiple
such cards. += Eventtrigger
