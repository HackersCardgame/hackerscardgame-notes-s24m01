Autistic people tend to be gifted in electronics, computer
stuff, computer science, algorithms... "maybe"

did not want people to find out what
is going on. So they tried to find out early who is autistic
(for example by fee the and who is
buying an assÂ¢ by the age of 14) and then
those people "possibly" shrinks) in question gave the
parents of the autistic child intentionally false advice; said
them things like " Won

". In fact the technical system they don't want
the people to know about would just activate bl card as
soon someone would talk about that, so the autistic
person is "sane" if he does not warn the other people that
the other people are betrayed by that system the
"Architect" does not want the people talk about.
