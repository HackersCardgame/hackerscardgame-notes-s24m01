So there are different programs, So QUANTUMTHEORY, QUANTUMNATION, QUANTUMBOT,
(QUANTUCOPPER and QUANTUMINSERT. You've heard of 2 few of them. il just go tough them
real quick

‘QUANTUMTHEORY essentially has a whole arsenal of zero-day exploits. Then the system deploys
what's called 9 ‘And a seasoned moth isan implant which dies after 30
‘days So think tat these guys ether took alotof acid or read a lot of Philp K Dick potentially
both

[applause

And they thought Philp K. Dick wasnt dystopian enough. Let's get beter at this. And after reading
‘VaUS.1 guess, they went on, and they also have as part of QUANTUMNATION what's called
VALIDATOR oF COMMONDEER. Now these are first-stage payloads that are done entirely in memory.
‘These explots essentially are where they look around to see if you have what are called PSPs, and
Wiss to see, lke, you know, you have Tipwire, f you have Ai, I you have some sort of sytem
tool that will detect an attacker is tampering sith files or something like this, ike a host intrusion
‘detection system, $9 VALIDATOR and COMMONDEER, which, tmean, clearly the point of
COMMONDEER, while Its misspelled here ~ its not actually, | mean thats the name ofthe program
but the point isto make a pun on commandeering your machine

So, you know, when | think about the U.S. Constitution in particular, we talk about not allowing the
{quartering of soldiers and, osh, you know? Commandeering my computer sounds a ltlike 3,
Giital version ofthat, and I ind that a ite bt confusing, and mostly in that don understand how
‘they get away wit t but par of tis Because unt rght now we ide know about, n public, which
[why we're releasing tis in the public interest so that we can have a better debate about whether
(oF not that counts in fact asa part ofthis type of what | would consider tobe tyranny, or perhaps you
‘ink tis measured and reasonable thing. | somehow doubt that.

‘ut in any case, QUANTUMBOT is where they hijack IRC bots, because, why not, they thought they
‘would lke todo that, and an interesting point is that they could in theory stop a lot ofthese botnet
