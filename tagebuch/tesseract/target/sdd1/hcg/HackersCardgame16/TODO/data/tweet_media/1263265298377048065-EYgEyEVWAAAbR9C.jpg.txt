There are several (most not working) methods how they try
to delete information in the brains of WhiteHats /
Whistleblowers, rape victims.... cl, c2, a16, dtl, m22, m27,
m41, m44, ma5, m15, t10, co4, m42, but definitley m19.
Maybe deleting the scenes of a rape situation would help
the victim, maybe. Think of the drawing as a visual
representation (map) of the your brain and the purple part
is what they want to overwrite.

Unfortunately brain is not two dimensional, so this would
maybe work for a while but, and "“anti"psychotics would
"help" to keep the victim silent, but in the end nothing is
really deleted and just reduces the intelligence. That's
where the 1960s People have great long-term job
opportunities in the survaillance business payed by the
perpetrator, but after a while this "maybe" fails too...
