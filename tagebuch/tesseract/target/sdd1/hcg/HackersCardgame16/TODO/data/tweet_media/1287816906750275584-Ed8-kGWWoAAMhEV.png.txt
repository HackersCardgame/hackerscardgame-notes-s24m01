Halli Halle aus Aarau
Hello From Aaray

I once Studied CS at FHA / FHINW. Today always if/when i try to do
Security Research to make my Computers more secure i end up in [ Prison
| Hospitals | Mental Institutions ]

Currently I was wondering, if some unnamed big US Secret Service could
have made a complete Product out of your research, eq with templates for
specific hardware, or for example with some sort of endpoint malware
that when it's installed logs the keystrokes and communicates with a
nearby SR to generate such templates automatically

So i wonder if you two have any answers to this question
With kind Regards
