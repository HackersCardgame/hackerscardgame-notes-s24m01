With Vectors and Matrices you can calculate Networks.
For example this image is from an app that is not allowed
anymore on facebook. It could extrapolate all my groups
in Aarau i was part of: Primary School Kittigen (color 1),
Bezirksschule Aarau (color 2), Boy&Girl Scouts Aarau
(color 3), University of Applied Sciences (FHA) where i
studied first (color 4). And this information was generated
only from the interconnections between the elements
(see al2 card) not even from the things people posted. If
you would add Natural Language Processing and eg.
some sort of Mayer-Briggs or Big5 Psychology test you
could generate quite good personalized Suicide Death
Bots (see card al6), counter measure, warn the people
that some criminal people did and do such things to me
and are maybe doing such thigns also to other people
