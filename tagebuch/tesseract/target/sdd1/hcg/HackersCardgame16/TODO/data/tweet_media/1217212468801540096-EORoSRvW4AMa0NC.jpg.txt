A forensic disk controller or hardware write-block device is 2 specialize type of computer hard disk controller made fr the purpose of gaining read-only access to computer hard drives without
the risk of damaging the drive's contents. The device is named forensic Because its most common application is for use in investigations where a computer hard dive may contain evidence. Such a
controle histrieally has been made in the form ofa dongle that its between a computer and an IDE oF SCSI harddrive, but with the advent of USB and SATA, forensic dsk controllers supparting these
newer technologies have become widespread. Steve Bress and Mark Men2 invented hard drive write blocking (US Patent 6 813,682).

‘The United States National institute of justice operates a Computer Forensics Too Testing (CFTT) program whic formally identifies! the folowing top level tool requirements:

+ Anaranare write block (WA) device shal net transmit a command toa protected storage device that modifies the data onthe storage device
‘An ie device shal return the data requested by a read operation 5
+ An Hive device shal return without modification any access significant information requested from the drive. pieces seals
+ Any errr condition reported byte storage device tthe HWE device shal be reported tothe host.

Description est

Forensic disk controllers intercept write commands from the host operating system, preventing them from reaching the deve, Whenever the host bus architecture supports ithe contoller reports that
the drive is read-only The disk controller can elther deny all wites tothe disk and report them as fallures, or use on-board memory to cache the writes fr the duration of the session

{disk controller that caches writes in memary presents the appearance tothe operating system tha the drive is writable, and uses the memory to ensure thatthe operating sytem sees changes to the
Individual disk sectors attempted to overwrite. does this by retrieving sectors from the disk ifthe operating system hasnt attempted to change them, and retrieving the changed version from memory
for sectors thathave been changed.

Forensic disk controllers are mast commonly associated with the process of creating a disk image, or acquisition, during forensic analysis. Their use is to prevent inadvertent modiication of evidence.

Using hardware to protect the hard drive from witess very important fo several reasons. Fst, many operating systems, including Windows, may write to any hard isk thats connected tothe system,
[tthe very least, Windows wil update the access time for any ie accessed, and may write things tothe disk unexpectedly - uch as creating hidden folders forthe recycle bin or saved hardware
configuration, Virus infections or malware on the system used for analysis may attempt to infect the disk being inspected. Additionally, the NTFS filesystem may attempt to commit er rollback unfinished
transactions, andior change flags onthe volume to markit as “in use". A the Worst, undesited files may allocate and overwrite deleted space onthe hard disk which may potentaly destroy evidence in
the form of previously deleted files

Protecting an evidence drive from writes during investigation is also important to counter potential allegations that the contents of the drive were altered during the investigation. Ofcourse, this can be
alleged anyway, butin the absence of technology to protect drive from writes, there i no way for such an allegation tobe refuted,
