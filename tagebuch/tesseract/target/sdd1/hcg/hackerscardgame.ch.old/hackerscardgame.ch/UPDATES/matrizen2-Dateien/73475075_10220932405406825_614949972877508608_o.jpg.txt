Role/Archetype
Guybrush Threepwood had the role of the hero
In the Lucas Arts gane Monkey Tstand™

In classic tarot he would be "The Fool"
Card, actually too stupid to save the world,
but has non-normal-distributed luck and his
childish behavior gives him high values in
‘the sayer-briggs dimension “agreeableness”
which would be perfect as a chessfigure
