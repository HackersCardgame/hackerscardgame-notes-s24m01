One can identify the action with cams PatternRecognition
of a certain period of time

Pseudo Formula:
actionRecog = patternRecog(t)

based on that data one could identify objects, since many
actions can be done only with certain objects.

Eg. normally identifies the
pullover. Especially when you have not that much input data
one could identify may objects without having a cam but only
with spectral data of WiFi (Tensors) to recognize it or with
FitBit, Bewegungsfelder. Then add it to the 3D Model (m98/
m99) It would take maybe a month but you could indentify
maybe almost everything in a period of a month? That's maybe
how they know what children do in their bed,
