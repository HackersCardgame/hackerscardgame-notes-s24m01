RISK SCORE: 10

Inventor:

The newest versions read
EEG data transmits signals to brain. Can activeate certain
functions in brain, wires in the Amygdala would probably cause
agressions (b1 card). Active community (read only, and non-
invasive) on Twitter: @OpenBCl. Even things like directly "built-in"
Augmented Reality (Like PokemonGO) could be achieved with
such technologies. There are maybe other ways
W0O2005055579A1, US4877027... ( ). Maybe sold as lie
detector (co2,m57,m77,m125...) reads thoughts & emotions,
influences emotions, automate/abuse victims, CryEngine / Unity
(m98,m99,t32,m60...)

for the group m46 first as shown as m41 over t1 then
m37 -> m46 -> dt1 so people could not integrate the existence of
things like Stimoceiver in their world view, Matthaeus::7::1

video not mentioning implants, i question that, Youtube CIA Honeypot?
