The role of the judge is one of the most powerful in
the system, in many movies shown as a fat "cute"
Santa Claus. The role / chess piece would be perfect
for a mastermind of a military dictatorship. If the
judge and the jury is controlled by technology cards
the accused would not get a fair process and nobody
would even find out who decidet to kill the accused,
even if he is innocent. Weekness would be the al5
card. it would also be perfect for a foreign aggressor,
secret service to subdue the whole system. In "To
protect and infect part 2" (12:17) @ioerror says "Is
not clear to me, that a Judge would understand
anything | just said", but thats wrong: that one does
not use al5 card implies, that he knows,
