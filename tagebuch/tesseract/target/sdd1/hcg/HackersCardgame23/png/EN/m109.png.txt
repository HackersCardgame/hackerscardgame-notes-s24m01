Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~????
System / Partents sells things as their idea the
kid would do anyway or things the kid invented.
Then they want that you say thank you for the
immaterial good they stole you. Mansplaining is
some sort of the same principle, see m81* Cards. If i
tell them that they shall not steal my immaterial
goods or ideas they begin to intimidate me with
"Sprengfallen aktivieren" (Mostly the voice of
$herFather). Unsure if i've been stalked by him, just
sample from linked on mouse/hand gesture and who
activates this.
