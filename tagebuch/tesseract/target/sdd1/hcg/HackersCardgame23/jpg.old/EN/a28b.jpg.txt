One can identify the action with cams PatternRecognition
of a certain period of time

Pseudo Formula:
actionRecog = patternRecog(t)

based on that data one could identify objects, since many
actions can be done only with certain objects.

Eg. pulling over a pullover normally identifies the
pullover. Especially when you have not that much input data
one could identify may objects without having a cam but only
with spectral data of WiFi (Tensors) to recognize it or with
FitBit, Bewegungsfelder. Then add it to the 3D Model (m98/
m99) It would take maybe a month but you could indentify
maybe almost everything in a period of a month? That's maybe
how they know what children do in their bed, we as a
community should mitigate that if we can verify that.
