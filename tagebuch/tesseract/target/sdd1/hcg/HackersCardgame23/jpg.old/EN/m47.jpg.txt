If you ask Google ABDL means "Ad Blocker" but maybe it
has another meaning. But maybe it's for those who have
the bad luck not to having own kids. But if you have kids
people maybe would thinkg you are pedophile.
Important: make sure that the does not make
your partner think you secretly maried someone else and
have kids with him or her.

But playing with only one equal aged sane and
consensual with diapers or acting like you are again 14 or
4 year old (with 1+) maybe also helps to process things
that went wrong in the (early) childhood. Calling a friend
"GuggeliAnbeter" when he is 30 looks maybe like an
insult, but can also have the effect, that the one the older
generations made paranoid (me) remembersâ€™ our
childhood when we always insulted each other and when
we both knew, that it is not meant mean, but just meant
funny, helps decreasing paranoja if you have trust to.
