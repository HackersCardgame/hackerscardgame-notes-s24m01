Like the brain is split up into different areas, content in
the brain is also split up into knowledge areas. Maybe in
conjunction with b5 card that stimulates specific parts of
the neocortex.
My brain has some sort of black holes. co8 card is one of
them. Things that are to personal to talk about, things
that are private, things like abuse, rape, violence. Satan
seems to plant vectors into all other areas that point to
that traumatic event to make me silent, to stop me from
anaylzing data and situations, to stop me from warning
others from things satan did to me. this is maybe sorted
like some sort of personal libraries index where each
person has his own subset of knowledge areas.
Different Subsets of the knowledge, different world-views,
maybe inteintionally antagonizing (m50)
