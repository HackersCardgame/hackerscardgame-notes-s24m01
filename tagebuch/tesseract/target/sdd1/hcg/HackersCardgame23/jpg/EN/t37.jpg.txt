Chess Clock

Inventor:

IMHO there's sort of Cyber Mainframe Chess Clock that puts
people into dissociation state, makes them blind for certain
things or people, even if would live in same appartement.
Technically one could implement that with "Behavioral
Sciences" also known as Torture. If you cause strong PAIN
(see microdot below image) as soon as the one you love is in
sight (eyel card), maybe linked to an additional Stimulus
(accustic, visually, implants...) things or poeple might be
invisible

; best case: helps to GUARD the world,
since we don't know expect the worst. | don't have prove
yet, but there was a two seconde scene i can remember in
mental institution, where she stood in front of me and i was
on my knee having "some" pain, as soon as i have prove or
hacked it with the microdot i will maybe create a card in
hackers card game,
