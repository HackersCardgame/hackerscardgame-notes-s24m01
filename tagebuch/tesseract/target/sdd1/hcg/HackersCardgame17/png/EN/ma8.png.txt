Since the Roswell-Incident, the CIA not just started to
cover illegal Human Experiments with Alien Stories,
they also actively hunt those, who could be able to
leak details about the abusive system. In this case
"Man in Black" or "Enemy of State" (just outdated
technology Stuff so they gave it to the world and the
Farady Cage is not really a Faraday Cage...)
greetings to Will Smith, bzw. the movies are cool for
young boys except that detail.

Point No.1: No it is not sexism, the boy would be
more stubborn

Point No. 2: Don't buy Assembler Books when your
14 Years old, see dt2 card

Point No. 3: Nor the girl would be on the dark side
