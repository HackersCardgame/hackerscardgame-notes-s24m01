The usual rhetorical automatism would be
"Everyone has his price" even Judges are for sale.
We think "Everyone" is a rumor, i for example
would never intentionally do harm to a younger
child, not for 100'000'000$. But many young people
do not realize, that their wages actually are paid by
Satan. Not informed by the company, that many
people had to die for the profit, and if the young
employee would ask relevant questions about illegal
things company does they would fire him or more
worse things like they did to Mollath (Germany) that
not even worked there. Many rich people can easily
hush murder and rape with money. They even buy
the judge that wears a price tag instead of moral
and justice.
