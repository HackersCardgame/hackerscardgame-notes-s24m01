Depending on the authorization (or the security
clearance) of a user folders are shown or not shown in a
Windows Netzwork. The same principle maybe also
applies to websites, youtube, facebook, twitter and
maybe even github... if you consider the m50 card the
same system "could" be used to split society into two+
separate groups, and there would be even some triggers
known to some of the older groups to start a civil war
between this two groups.
Maybe explaining Access Based Ennumeration++ to
the society would deescalate this problem a bit.
So update your people with this knowledge. | learned
about Access Based Ennumeration at ABB
Technikerschule Baden, hopefully only the students not
yet joined the dark side, but some of thier parents...
unfortunately did.
