Karma seems to be abused for malware that is autopoietic,
that is transmitted eg. from Neuralink to Neuralink. Or
after such a "fishing crusade" @ioerror takled about in "To
protect and infect, part 2". If you report such an attack to
the people that should have an eye on that, the malware
tells them that the person that reported it is the offender,
even if he is 1980s generation, it would be likely that
these sort of attacks are generated not from a single
person but from a bigger network. In Mental Institutions
often the system tells that one will be infected with bad
karma by other patients -> avoidance behavior to help.

| think karma would be great, that if you really try to help
people that this would give you some benefits.

but the above variant of karam is possibly more some sort
of military way of blaming religions for attacks the do in
"complete secrecy"... maybe not as secret anymore
