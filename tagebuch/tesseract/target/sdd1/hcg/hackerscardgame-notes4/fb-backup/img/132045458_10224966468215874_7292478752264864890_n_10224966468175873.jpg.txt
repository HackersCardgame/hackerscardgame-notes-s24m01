With Vectors and Matrices you can calculate Networks.
For example this image is from an app that is not allowed
anymore on facebook. It could extrapolate all my social
groups in Aarau i was part of: Primary School Kuttigen
(color 1), Bezirksschule Aarau (color 2), Boy & Girl Scouts
Aarau (color 3), University of Applied Sciences (FHA)
where i studied (color 4). And this information was
generated only from the interconnections (metadata)
between the elements (see al2 card) not even from the
things people posted. If you would add Natural Language
Processing (see a20 Card) and eg. some sort of Mayer-
Briggs or Big5 Psychology test, you could generate quite
good personalized Suicide Death Bots :( (see card al6),
counter measure, warn the people that some criminal
people/agents did and do such things to me and are
doing such thigns also to other young people.
