Lecture: Psychedelic Medicine - Hacking Psychiatry?!
Psychedelic Therapy as a fundamentally new approach to mental health issues
Psychedelic research constitutes a challenge to the current
paradigm of mental healthcare. But what makes it so different? And Info Speakers

will it be able to meet the high expectations it is facing? This talk will
provide a concise answer.

Psychedelic Therapy is evolving to be a game changer in mental
healthcare. Where classical antidepressants and therapies e.g. for
Posttraumatic Stress Disorder often have failed to provide relief,
substance assisted psychotherapies with Psilocybin, LSD and MDMA
show promising results in the ongoing clinical trials worldwide.

A challenge to the current paradigm: Unlike the conventional approach of medicating
patients with antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs on a daily basis for months
and years ata time, Psychedelic Therapy offers single applications of psychedelics or
emotionally opening substances such as Psilocybin, LSD and MDMA within the course of
a limited number of therapeutic sessions. The clinical trials conducted in this kind of
setting are currently designed around depression, substance abuse, anxiety and

depression due to life threatening illnesses, PTSD, anorexia and social anxiety in Autism.

Though the results look promising, it is important not to take these therapies for a
“magic bullet cure” for all and very patient will mental issues. This talk will outline the
principles of psychedelic therapy and research and provide a concise overview of what
psychedelic therapy can and cannot offer in the future.
