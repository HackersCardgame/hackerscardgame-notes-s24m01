Blessings
(eg. Ultra-Violet or Acid
Burnings in Face)

Inventor:
IMHO the criminals use Violence, Posion, Acid and such things to
distract people ike me that asks “to many” relevant questions. if
{am confronted with a bumed face they transmit a lot of
‘missinformation(s) that is “used! later to steer me Into a wrong
direction. it makes also paranoid, depressed (m94 card) and
| guess they did this also
with the people that asked questions if'm the bad guy, and that
Jed them think that i am the criminal, since they question me
‘and are “therefor” beeing attacked, then it would completely
‘make Sense to belive that | am the offender or the criminal. But
just saying "burned face" = innocent would also be wrong, see
‘914 card. unknown: atleast 3 “use cases" for violence
2) violence against people that question a scapegoat, would
‘make the scapegoat look more guilty
») violence against whistleblower, make him do mistakes
ole ‘would order violence against himself to make him
look mare innocent,

giving Multiple Reasons
at the same time to
poison elaborate facts

Inventor: Year:

If you would have some “unseen” communication
channel like US4877027 or Stimoceiver or Neuralink
and something happens like your face suddenly gets
bumed (see m121 Card) then there are many reasons
given why this happened or how this happened.
Often only junk and spam that would lead you into
the wrong direction, Take a pencil and paper and note
all of them down, some of them you can elmininate
because there are mistakes in that reason. some you
can not, but if you note all the clames and then it
would be easy to find the pivot element
($1940sShrink&Sherfather) since people tend to use
often the same chess pieces and moves.

Attacks that lead
to the same problem
or to the same result

Cause 1
™

—

Pa distraction

Cause 3

Inventor: Year:
There seems to be a generic pattern the criminals
Use to keep things and attacks secret, They attack
me with different attacks that all lea ne sam
if you try to prove Cause 1 then they bring
facts why it must be Cause 2, so the different causes
help each other to Not sure if
a generic principle of secret services to keep things
secret or criminals that are criminal since many
decades and just trained to do attacks with such a
dirthy trick. But it would definitly imply that the
People doing this is organized crime. So there would
be some PsyOP or Master of this network, we guess
this is "Dr $1940sShrink and SherFather/SherMother
is one of his terrorist teams. So it must be some sort
of christian terrometwork that uses NSAJCIA access

Don't Stare at the
Sun Algorithm

+ CIA

+ NSA |

+ Scapegoat

Year:

In. my opinion after every

‘the psychological CIA part of
this software tries to make the people focus down the
hierary, eg on the Scapegoat, that was attracted with a
isco computer scolarship in 2002. 1 guess it are
personified prerendered Socio-Psychology design patterns,
fevictimizing things, even attacks me over spinal-cord
implants, tries to drive me to take knive m32,m44, after
such a attack, people seem to focus on scapegoat /
hostage, often they prerender accusations and add
{virtualfreal] jury that judges [himlher].

See Farbrausch fr-036* which one
should do, scapegoats have Informations! Unknown: we
should detect that: +=Eventtrigger: IF kid (or 41 years old
kid") cries every 3h it's maybe subject to PsyWarfare.
