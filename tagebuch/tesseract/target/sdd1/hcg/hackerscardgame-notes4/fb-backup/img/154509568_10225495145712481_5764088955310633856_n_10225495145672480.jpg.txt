btw: making fun about such sort of military stuff is a good coping strategy, so if you know german, watch / read this:

Hi Martin

Lots of problems, i guess at least on Windows they use GTK to route Windows GUID's trough to the application. Adding Mansplainig-
EventTriggers based on GUID's of buttons, register cards, generally GUI Elements is maybe a "secret default windows function and is
maybe used for bitching um behavioral "sciences". so far just a hypothesis, but if true this maybe would explain why there is that much
terror they activate against me... GIMP, Inkscape, kdenlive ... maybe also other frameworks beside gtk...

Greetings
