Abstract

"Brainjacking’ refers to the exercise of unauthorized control of another's electronic brain
implant. Whilst the possibility of hacking a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) has already been
proven in both experimental and real-life settings, there is reason to believe that it will soon be
possible to interfere with the software settings of the Implanted Pulse Generators (IPGs) that
play a central role in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems. Whilst brainjacking raises ethical
concerns pertaining to privacy and physical or psychological harm, we claim that the
possibility of brainjacking DBS raises particularly profound concerns about individual
autonomy, since the possibility of hacking such devices raises the prospect of third parties
exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning the subject’s cognitive, emotional and
motivational states. However, although it seems natural to assume that brainjacking
represents a profound threat to individual autonomy, we suggest that the implications of
brainjacking for individual autonomy are complicated by the fact that technologies targeted by
brainjacking often serve to enhance certain aspects of the user’s autonomy. The difficulty of
ascertaining the implications of brainjacking DBS for individual autonomy is exacerbated by
the varied understandings of autonomy in the neuroethical and philosophical literature. In
this paper, we seek to bring some conceptual clarity to this area by mapping out some of the

prominent views concerning the different dimension of autonomous agency, and the

implications of brainjacking DBS for each dimension. Drawing on three hypothetical case
