sources about this sort of things they upload Porn or even
Pedophilia Content to your computer and activate the

Brain Implants need Firmware. We found out, that they
normally have some sort of life of its own. They can include
most cards in hackerscardgame we already found out and
leaked. Normally Satan uploads complete worldviews (MOS*
Cards), event gers, one will notice the big difference
(bash: diff A B) for example i seem to have an eventtrigger
that recognizes: "Add another card to HackersCardgam
> smokel Card and lot of other problems. General Panciple
‘seems to be that older people get the Psychological Keys of
the younger people. That Instrument of Power leads to
Power Abuse, and this abuse creates a Permanet Record,
that is then used by the parents of the parents... i found
that out when i went on a bycicle ride at night, away from
civilisation, devices wrapped in tin foil and it was raining
(on/less drones). unfortunately even if you are OFFLINE
these devices seem to record what you say or even think
and they abuse it later against me. Normally you can not
talk about this sort of things because you will get in serious
troubles, but you can ")

If one would evaluate the mouse-gestures
one could control the same system like
described in t46. As far as i know, windos
does not record mouse gestures. So one
could control many things without having a
logfile, theoretically.

into a Matrix and compare” this Matrix with
codes / cammands that are available. one
could do it more complex but that would be
sufficient i guess.

infinite loop

Activation-Times

Inventor: Petron Corporation (1933) ~1952
An analogue continuous tape, where one can
record suggestions such as e.g. 2 + 2 = 5, which is
automatically activated at certain times. The
tape will automatically turn off after 5 minutes. With
digital Equipment (computer / mobile phone / loT)
one can realize more complex systems. And there
are possibly also several different cannels, (see
cards t1, t7, t3, t12)

During the night: overwrite things (cO5 card) or
leaming things while sleeping, eg. foreign
languages, unfortunately you can also upload a
complete (wrong) world view to the brain, or
antagonizing world views or dogmas to split society
into two groups that fight each other (see card m50,
or eg. ma5 vs ma6)

Technically it would have been possible to do
this maybe already with electron tubes (~ 1900).
Psychological Perspective: people that abuse such
technology would keep that secret and previously labeled
as a "Schizophrenic" the victim is completely defenseless
and it is likely they induced suicide or amok. In
combination with e.g. a loop recorder, see also co2 Card,
the perpetrators often caused permanent damage in the
psyche of their victims; PTSD (#Verdingkinder /

On my balkony there seems to be an evenntrigger that is
shown on something like Stimoceiver or Neuralink: "Jump
Now". To prime they run things like JusPrimaeNoctis
(m38) and activate the Active Denial System (t15) or
trigger my amygdala implant (b1). | often tried, but i ha:
luck so not yet jumped, but almost. They seem to
train this habit with cards t2, tll, t7, a16, m32, m44..
‘one could knwo when to start this algorithm with just
positional data (eg GPS, mé60), if victim has body
telemetry (2 RFID Chips or 2 resonant circuit in the head /
skull or retina CCD (a19), they could even calculate what
the victim is currently looking at to trigger this event
(t14). Maybe fear or faith (m57, m77) of the victim is also
added to this algorithm. If i have a spinalcord implant (t6)
maybe this prevented my death, but if this would be
hacked i could not even prevent my death.

I'm not sure what Elon's plan is, but i'm sure the
NSAJCIA would like to make a #HoneyPOT out of that
Product and even blame Elon if things go wrong, that
are maybe caused by another smaller implant, see
microsdots t1 card, especially the small ones from
Neuronexus on the coin.

If Elon tries to mitigate the problems the older
implants causes this would be really great.

Castle Wolfenstein (Muse Software) was maybe not the
first 3D Engine, but maybe it was the first enduser 3D
Engine. Like a SkinnerBOX (t2 Card) but "innocently"
wrapped as children's toy that uses invasive (eg t1 card)
or (eg t12, t8... Cards) technologies. Such
games can be or bi nal (eg. b4 card)
Similar to a network monitoring system possibly with
Plug-INs, which are partially not even accessable by the
user, or as a separate addon that just evaulates symbols
in the game (eyel card) or bigger things like Quantum
Inserts, Turbine, Tarmoil. Game, |, therapy or "therapy",

Mayer-Briggs or even MMPI2. For example i bought a

Inventor:

With enough computational Power one could create avatars
(speech synthesis / deep fakes) that are “touring
complete". = Avatar that can do everything real person
could also do. Initially they used samples but one would
find out if they use the same sample over and over again.
Sociology design patterns with multiple touring complete
Avatars one even could simulate complete real-live
situations. You can never be sure if person you hear on eg
Stimoceiver/US4877027 is really the person/group you are
talking with. So best thing is to meet face to face (then
they abuse this technology too but if you know this person
well you would possibly find out).

unknown. If one k about this sort of
technology it would be likely that they create avatars for
the people he knows and trusts, like Family or near friends.

They have some sort of a of victims, whistleblowers,
whitehat hackers, Lab Rats, Verdingkinder where
they can set eventtriggers (t14) or even create an atl out of
their victim. Generated from eg. RetinaCCD (eyel, a9,
Photogrammetry) or body telemetry (RFID in extremities) or an
older system like resonant cirquits. Maybe a persons position
could also be extrapolatet just from accustic data, for example
if you have more than 2 Laptops with microphone (see
IEEE1588) and a model of the apartment. They have also
access to my amygdala implant (bi) and at the same time

SherFamily in 2002 (interactive, bidirectional, almost killed

psychological design-patterns, new Cyber'War equipment /
