MoCap one step further with a freely configurable motion capturing system based on strap-on, WiFi-

‘The Bewegungsfelder system consists of multiple, ESP8266-powered standalone IMU sensor nodes and a

motion capturing server. Attached to a person’s body (or anything else) the nodes wirelessly stream the NEVER MISS A HACK
output of their onboard MPU60S0 6-axis accelerometer/gyroscope to a central motion capturing server.

‘A server application translates the incoming data into skeletal animations, visualizes them as a live preview
and stores the MoCap data for later use. Because the sensor nodes are entirely seltcontained, they fyoa=
can be easily reconfigured to any skeletal topology, be it a human, a cat, or an industrial robot.
