128 INNOVATION AND EXPERIAUENT IN MODREN RDVEATION

illnesses, but their value is even greater because they represent the
proof that behavior and mental functions can be influenced by physi-
cal means and, therefore, bring the study of the mind to the domain
of experimental sciences. This approach, however, does not prejudge
the possible existence of other aspects of mental functions related to
psychological, spiritual, or even religious conceptions of man, To the
contrary, it recognizes that in the same way that light is simultaneous-
ly corpuscle and wave, and atoms are both matter and energy, mental
functions may also have multidimensional characteristics which will
not be revealed by a single type of methodology and may require
different physical and intellectual tools to be understood. The mind
of the scientist must be kept open to possible philosophical interpreta-
tions while he continues his investigations.

Motor performance, emotions, and ideas are related to electrical
flashes of the cerebral neurons which we can now detect, measure, and
analyze, Science has very recently developed new and powerful tools
for the investigation of the conscious brain, and these tools are wait-
ing for the many brains of new students who will use them to full ad-
vantage, We are in a precarious race between the acquisition of many
megatons of destructive power and the development of intelligent
human beings who will make intelligent use of the formidable forces
at our disposal. The brain scientists may help the educators, but they
need the educators? help.

T would like to close by asking your cooperation in spreading the
message to your students that the mind is no longer considered an ob-
scure metaphysical entity, but a concrete experimental reality with
functions which may be evoked, inhibited, recorded, and analyzed.
We need more students and more effort in mental research because
these investigations may clarify the basis of human behavior and will
probably bring more happiness to human beings than the advances in
the physical sciences. Indeed, knowledge of the human mind may be
decisive for our pursuit of happiness and for the very existence of
mankind.
