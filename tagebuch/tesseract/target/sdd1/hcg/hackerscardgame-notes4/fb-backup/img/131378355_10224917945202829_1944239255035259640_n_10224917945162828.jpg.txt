Inventor: José Manuel Rodriguez Delgado~1950
Originally developed by Delgado, possibly been
enhanced "in secrecy" since 70 Years, placed directly
in the brain, and with software like OpenBCl and
maybe Deep Learnign’ algorithms possibly
recognizes even detaild thougths. (see Neuralink,
Elon Musk, HoneyPot) No matter how good the
encryption would be, if wires are mede out of
metallic wires all such devices would be vulnerable
to side-channel attacks [fc = A /n] if geometry if the
wires are know and there is a transmitting device
with enough power nearby. (unsure if t25 or t26 or
both cards) | tweeted to Elon Musk asking what he is
going to do about this vulnerability, but he did not
answer so far. Maybe just HoneyPot for older
technologies, and maybe Hashtags are filtered.
