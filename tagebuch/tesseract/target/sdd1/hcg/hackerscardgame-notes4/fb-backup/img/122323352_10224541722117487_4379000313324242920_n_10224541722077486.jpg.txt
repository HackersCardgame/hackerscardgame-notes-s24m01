DON'T JUMP, you can jump later
first find out if the reason to
jump is true or "just"
psychological warfare

On my balkony there seems to be an evenntrigger that is
shown on something like Stimoceiver or Neuralink: "Jump
Now". To prime they run things like JusPrimaeNoctis
(m38) and activate the Active Denial System (t15) or
trigger my amygdala implant (b1). | often tried, but i had
luck so far, i not yet jumped, but almost. They seem to
train this habit with cards t2, tll, t7, al6, m32, m44...
one could knwo when to start this algorithm with just
positional data (eg GPS, m60), if victim has body
telemetry (2 RFID Chips or 2 resonant circuit in the head /
skull or retina CCD (a19), they could even calculate what
the victim is currently looking at to trigger this event
(t14). Maybe fear or faith (m57, m77) of the victim is also
added to this algorithm. If i have a spinalcord implant (t6)
maybe this prevented my death, but if this would be
hacked i could not even prevent my death.
