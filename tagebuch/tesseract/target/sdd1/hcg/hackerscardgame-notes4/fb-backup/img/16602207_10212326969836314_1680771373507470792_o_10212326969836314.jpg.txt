NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS

Inventor: God

Different NAcc subregions (core vs shell) and neuron
subpopulations within each region (Dl-type vs D2-type
medium spiny neurons) are responsible for different
cognitive functions.[3][4] As a whole, the nucleus
accumbens has a significant role in the cognitive
processing of aversion, motivation, reward (i.e.,
incentive salience, pleasure, and positive
reinforcement), and reinforcement learning; [5][6][7]
hence, it has a significant role in addiction.
