compromise other people's routers and then redirect through them so that they can beat the speed of light

‘And how they do that is that they have a passive sensor that's nearby a thing that they can inject from, and when
they see that thing sees a selector that is interesting to them or is doing a thing that they would like to tamper
with in some way, then they take a packet, they encapsulate the packet, they send it to the diode, which might be
your home router potentially, and then that home router decapsulates that packet and sends it out. And because
that is very close to you, and let's say you're visiting Yahoo, then the Yahoo packet will not beat you. That is,
they will not beat the NSA or GCHQ. So it's a race condition. And so they basically are able to control this whole
system and then localize attacks in that process.

So that's a pretty — pretty scary stuff, actually. And while itis a digital thing, | think it's important to understand
that this is what Jefferson talked about when he talked about tyranny. This is turnkey tyranny, and it's not that it's
coming, it's actually here. It's just merely a question about whether or not they'll use it in a way that we think is a
good way or not a good way.

One of the scariest parts about this is that for this system or these sets of systems to exist, we have been kept
vulnerable. So itis the case that if the Chinese, if the Russians, if people here wish to build this system, there's
nothing that stops them. And in fact the NSA has in a literal sense retarded the process by which we would
secure the internet because it establishes a hegemony of power, their power in secret to do these things. And in
fact 've seen evidence that shows that there are so many compromises taking place between the different Five
Eyes signals intelligence groups that they actually have lists that explain, “If you see this back door on the
system, contact a friendly agency. You've just recompromised the machine of another person.”

So when we talk about this, we have to consider that this is designed for at-scale exploitation. And as far as | can
tell i's being used for at-scale exploitation. Which is not really in my mind a targeted particularized type of thing,
but rather it's ‘operations. It's ‘expeditions. It's more like if you will. And in some
cases, looking at the evidence, that seems to be what it is. Targeting Musiims, | might add, because that's what
they're interested in doing

So that said, that's the internet, and we get all the way down to the bottom and we get to the Close Access
Operations and Off-Net. Off-Net and Close Access Operations are pretty scary things, but basically this is what
we would call a black bag job. That's where these guys, they break into your house, they put something in your
‘computer and they take other things out of your computer.

Here's an example. First top secret document of the talk so far.
