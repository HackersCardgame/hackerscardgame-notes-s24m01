Abstract

'Brainjacking’ refers to the exercise of unauthorized control of another’s electronic brain
implant. Whilst the possibility of hacking a Brain—Computer Interface (BCD) has already been
proven in both experimental and real-life settings, there is reason to believe that it will soon be
possible to interfere with the software settings of the Implanted Pulse Generators (IPGs) that
play a central role in Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) systems. Whilst brainjacking raises ethical
concerns pertaining to privacy and physical or psychological harm, we claim that the
possibility of brainjacking DBS raises particularly profound concerns about individual
autonomy, since the possibility of hacking such devices raises the prospect of third parties
exerting influence over the neural circuits underpinning the subject’s cognitive, emotional and

motivational states. However, although it seems natural to assume that brainjacking
