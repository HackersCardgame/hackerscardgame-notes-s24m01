When i work with my computer there seems to be an
algorithm that detects when my work is efficient and then
stops me with dirthy tricks..

The problems are not always in the same order, but
efficiency seems to be an eventtrigger that starts such
things smokel, m98, m99, acid in my face cream.

One can produce situations, where people are played
off against each other. You could do this with drugs,
for example giving one person chemicals that make
happy and funny and the other person chemicals that
make sad. Wirst case both victims will begin to fight
each other while both victims think that he or she
does the right thing. Maybe such chemicals were
involved in Stanford prison experiment, unsure. But
with Technology cards (eg. tl...) you could possibly
produce similar situations. Or in Politics, race,
gender, Nazi » jews... or with just showing good or
bad Facebook ‘content (facebook experiment, see
Internet). For example also to tell sone people that
the accused younger boy is guilty and therefor it
would be “legitimite” that an older person takes his
goods would create the same situation, the unjust
decision is often in favour of the stronger like
$herFather that has weapons... NOTICE UNSEEN THIRD.

With stimulus-response habits, for example if you get
aly ward (m8, see also card b1, b2, b3, t1...) and
after 1000 repetitions you would get punishment instead
of a reward (m7) they can induce rage. Or if a person
invests a lot of time in a game and then would be banned
forever from the Game (more worse if was an unfair
decision) this can induce rage. If one has something like a
working that protects him/her then
such psychological attacks could not kill, but if the spinal
cord is hacked people can be killed without Psychological
Warfare / Cognitive Dissonances. Such Software can
produce people that run amok or suicide. You can not
only blame the remote Controlled Person. Try to find both,
the remote controlled BOT and the person developed that
interface or Server or abuses it. https://marclandolt.ch/

Swiss Army has dishes to send data rather slow if
you read the specs over discance up to 50 miles.
They use the band around 15GHz (A = 20mm).
Equipment to measure such high frequencies you
need a device that costs ~20'000 sFR. Out of reach
for many poor people in Switzerland. As soon as
one would have an implant or only a golden wire of
the length of A/n the energy would maybe
sufficient to induce 50mvV that would stimulate eg.
the brain. If the implant is in the amygdala (b1
card) it would possibly induce rage. WARNING: if
true, you don't want to be the guy that found
that out. With similar technology it would be quite
easy to even force good judges to eg. extradite

The amygdala also corpus amygdaloideum; Latin,
from Greek éuvybaAn, is one of two almond-shaped
groups of nuclei located deep and medially within
the temporal lobes of the brain in complex
vertebrates, including humans. Shown in research to
perform a primary role in the process 5
decision-making, and emotional reactions, the
amygdalae are considered part of the limbic system,

Normally when TV talks about Motion
Capture they show Motion Capture with
pattern recognition software and cams. But
one could do this also with gyro-sensors, with
RFID's, with LC-Cirquits with different
frequencies, metal detector, rardar, naked
scanners...... This image is from

And as in m41 we might add:
we are not worthy

Object Recognition
Action Recognition

One can identify the action with cams PatternRecognition
of a certain period of time

Pseudo Formula:
actionRecog = patternRecog(t)

based on that data one could identify objects, since many
actions can be done only with certain objects,

Pseudo 3
actionRecog, € Objet,

Eg. pulling over a pullover normally identifies the
pullover. Especially when you have not that much input data
‘one could identify may objects without having a cam but only
with spectral data of WiFi (Tensors) to recognize it or with
FitBit, Bewegungsfelder. Then add it to the 3D Model (m98/
m99) It would take maybe a month but you could indentify
maybe almost everything in a period of a month? That's maybe
how they know what children do in their bed, we as a
community should mitigate that if we can verify that.
