Sons have often problems with their fathers. Fathers often
bully their sons, they abuse their sons, they torture their
sons, they attack their sons (no matter if physically or
verbally) After a while the son is old enough to defend
himself, the justice system is norally not very interested in
this things, but this causes the sons to become evil, maybe
learned this behavior from their father, and are doing the
same to younger people because they learned that it is
"legitimate" to do this. In some cases then the father would
punish the oldest son (son1) even more because he does the
same to the younger son (son2), unsure if just reason to
punish a weaker like the chief does or really wants to
protect the youngest. (Bigger Domain Model: Money beats
m72 Card, m72 card beats unfortunately m24 card)

This behavior (psychology: introjection) then would be the
normal case and would feed problems into the wohle social
systems (also m102 karte) and finally hits also daughters too
