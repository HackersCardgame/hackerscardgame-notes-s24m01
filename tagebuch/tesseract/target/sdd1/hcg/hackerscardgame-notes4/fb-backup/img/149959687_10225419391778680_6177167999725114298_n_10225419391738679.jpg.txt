Introduction

The cybercrime underworld hasn't given me any exciting malware to reverse and I'm running out of ideas for new

posts, so I'm going to do a2 part article about the techniques used by rootkits to intercept function calls, and how
to detect them. The first part will explain some hooking methods, the second part will explain how to detect them.
As | haven't done any kernel mode stuff on this blog. | will be looking at both user mode and kernel mode hooks

on a x86 windows system.

Execution Flow

In order to get a better understanding of the attack surface, I've made a simplified flow chart of a call to the
WriteFile function in kernel32.dll. This is just an example to highlight key points, | chose the WriteFile function as

it makes for a nice example, and disk I/O is commonly intercepted by malware, however most of the stuff on this

graph will apply to lots of functions.
