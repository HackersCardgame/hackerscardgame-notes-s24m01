after 9/11. It became instantaneously clear that viruses like poliovirus no longer
“exist” only in nature but also in computers. Viruses, therefore, can be synthesized
using the information stored in computers. These synthetic viruses have the com-
puter as parent — a natural isolate is no longer required.

This scenario immediately brings us to an ancient dilemma in science called
“dual use research.” Every result produced in science has the propensity to be use-
ful and/or harmful for humankind, In addition, every progress in biomedical tech-
nology yields the possibility to achieve new “unheard-of” results, like the chemical

synthesis of poliovirus. Currently, there are the genomes of >2,500 viruses available
