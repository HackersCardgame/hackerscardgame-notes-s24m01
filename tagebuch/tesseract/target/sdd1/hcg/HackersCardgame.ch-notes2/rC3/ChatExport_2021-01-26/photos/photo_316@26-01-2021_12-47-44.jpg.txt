Castle Wolfenstein (Muse Software) was maybe not the
first 3D Engine, but maybe it was the first enduser 3D
Engine. Like a SkinnerBOX (t2 Card) but "innocently"
pie cal as children's toy that uses invasive (eg t1 card)
vasive (eg eZ) = . Cards) technologies. Such
eerie can be ional or bidirectional (eg. b4 card).
Similar to a peor monitoring system possibly with
Plug-INs, which are partially not even accessable by the
user, or as a separate addon that just evaulates symbols
in the game (eyel card) or bigger things like Quantum
Inserts, Turbine, Tarmoil. Game, fun, therapy or "therapy",

back to me but i could not shoot him as a vegetarian.
