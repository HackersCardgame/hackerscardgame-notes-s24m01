re one Oe a ne eee people that bought eg. an
IBM System 3850 in the early days of modern

Psychological Profile of such a person would match
to rich people and therefor maybe also not the nicest
people. This would only be the first guess. If i would
be rich i would give all my money to save the world,
since there are still many problems on this world i
bet i am not completely wrong with my first guess.

Could we find out who bought this sort of mass
storage or other expensive? computer equipment in
the old days???
