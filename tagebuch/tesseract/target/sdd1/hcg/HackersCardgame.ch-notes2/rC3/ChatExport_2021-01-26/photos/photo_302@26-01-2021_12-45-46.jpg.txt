Like Pee Ken Thompson Hack one could _ infect

directly the Hardware. For example implementet like
hat went only after Siemens PLC's to brick

nuclear centrifuges this sort of Stuxnet would go

against VHDL / Verilog Software

Worst case there are also a variants that go against

. In 2019 there was the public case where
tern media blames the Chinese for placing
additional Chips on Supermicro Servers to obfuscate
this sort of attack. They even protected the details
about VHDL /Verilog. Some of them you can mitigate
software, tin foil, by useing a jamming device to jam
specific frequencies or with a soldering iron, some
you can not, choose your hardware wisely
