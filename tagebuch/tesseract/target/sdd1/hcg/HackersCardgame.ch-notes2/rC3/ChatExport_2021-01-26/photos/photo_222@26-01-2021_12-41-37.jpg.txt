Before i knew that much about the problem we have
here in switzerland i found out different things during
my work *$herFather: name the company SaveCom*
(Deep Packet Injection: Concept Knowledge: he
names the company to force the company to attack

e or as an future m157 Card)* where i mostly
worked 8h for money and again 8h for free to help all
those innocent crying voices that were sticked to the
payed task (some sort of a virtual paper clip, al7
Card) of my work. Finding out this sort of things is
maybe even organic. If you not yet sold your soul &&
if you are not ignorant, then most people can solve
the puzzle. To see the details, you need to look on the
original SVG and zoom in.
