When i was 20 Years old 3 "friends" used peer pressure over
a period of 6 months to make me consume Ecstasy in our
Music Studio below a (stereotype) Gym. We also watched the

equal aged Girl Rahel Sc. (they wanted me to fork, so i would
have been guilty of ruining someones live too and then i
would not leak all this informations) but i did not want to and

wanted to "enligthen" them as a gift. |
substance i already consumed, so i was not thinking about
that i could have poisonend them, but i possibly would.
