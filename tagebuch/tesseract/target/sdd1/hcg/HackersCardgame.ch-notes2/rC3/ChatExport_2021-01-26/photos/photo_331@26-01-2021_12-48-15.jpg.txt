Inventor: xxxxx Year: ~??2?
Since 1950s are things like (t1 outa he there
must be a device that e signal
from the Stimoceiver, or 70 Years later it aoe be
something like Company). If the
keys of an persons Neuralink would have been hacked or
leaked, the person with the key and the strongest M-Com-
Station could force the person do things he otherwise
would not do (wirst case at1 card) if the Implant has even
the ability to dissociate that person so that the person
does not remember anything (you could call that
is) it would be stupid to sentence only the "Bot".
Even if the "Bot" confessed that he has done the crime,
case is not yet over. The person who ownes the strongest
M-Com-Station would still be free and maybe plannig the
next, murder, rape, amok... But in the real world, it would
maybe look more than t26 card, tnx BFBC2 Honeypot
