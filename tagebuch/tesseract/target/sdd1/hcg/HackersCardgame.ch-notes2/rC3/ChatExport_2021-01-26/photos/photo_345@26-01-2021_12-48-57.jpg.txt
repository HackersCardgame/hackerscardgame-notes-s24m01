If Jurisitcations use 3D Models for surveillance
of accused people one shoul

device and the supplier.

Scapegoats for things t

would suggest local Juristications to do this
sort of surveillance, ae the device and
infrastructure would be owned by the CIA/NSA
to make the local jurictieation beleive that the
Scapegoat is really the criminal. First Problem
would be that the real criminal is still free and

say: "It is fair that the Criminal died" but they
would know that m37 -> dtl Card.
