Today this seems to be filtered by google, but you
find it on admin.ch. And if you search this on google
you find the websited on the right side of the card
image that seems to be also a new article, maybe
backdated? This would imply, that swiss army can
force google to filter things, and that implies that we
may mess with the same military dicatatorship...
They told this some soldiers in Art RS231 in ~1999.
INTAF means Integriertes Feuer und Feuerleitsystem
oder so. There they can enter there the targets to
hunt down, eg with Panzerhaubizen and it "maybe"

Card, but that's just speculation so far...
right i will get in Serious trouble for this card, see
"military dictatorship..."
