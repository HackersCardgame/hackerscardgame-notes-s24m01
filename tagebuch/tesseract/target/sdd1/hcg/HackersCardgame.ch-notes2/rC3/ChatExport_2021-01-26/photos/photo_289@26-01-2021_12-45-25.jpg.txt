(?) fool's cap

Inventor: XXXXX Year: ~?2??
In the Middle Ages a fool or a Tor (german: toricht =
foolish) was the person, who entertained the royal
household and was dressed mostly strange but
funny. The term "fool" also refers to persons who are
very immature, stupid, clumsy, biased, prejudiced,
ignorant. | guess "ignorant" was inserted later. The
fool is normally not ignorant and if the king has a
black heart it would be even dangerous to tell
himwhat many others think directly in his ******
face.

Kings often do not want to look in the mirror because
they know normally that they are fat, hairy and
ignorant. The fool tries to show the king his own
stupidity without being killed (jester's licence) by the
king ( = Satan )
