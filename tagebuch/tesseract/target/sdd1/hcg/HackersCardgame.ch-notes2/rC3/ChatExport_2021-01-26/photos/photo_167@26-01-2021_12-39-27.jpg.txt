Problem
(PsyOPs)

Inventor: Satan Year: ~????

sort of leds Circles in many subcultures
e circle can be out of individuals or out o
companies /Juristic Bese (Mainframes)

kids really think it would be good to kill the
whistleblower / whitehat hacker, because the parents show
them ad ae image of him cyber-raping innocent women on
the "i eye" (eyel, tl...) and enable an active denial
system (as, on t1) against the kids but in fact he does not
ber re ape ar y.

or to help him not to

become to powerful, "Scherbengericht"

Unfortunately the
PsyOPs kills 1 out of 80 and then dt1 card is played against
the circle of kids and also against the parents circle to mak
them do what Satan want them to do
