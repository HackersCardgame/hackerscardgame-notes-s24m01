hiding data
and evidence

Reenter

As a younger person one hig almost no possibilty .
store evidence in a way the older criminals

find or delete. Especially H you would have an nes
card they would know where you hide things. But if
you have for example a big library you could take an
SD-Card (i dont trust SD-Cards) or an USB Stick and
take of the housing, then you can put that in a book
from a library. If you close your eyes and select a
random book you dont even know by your own then it
is stored and even you would have to search a while
until you have the stick back, but the older criminals

prove that they are actively searching for evidence, so
you can call the police and make your case.
