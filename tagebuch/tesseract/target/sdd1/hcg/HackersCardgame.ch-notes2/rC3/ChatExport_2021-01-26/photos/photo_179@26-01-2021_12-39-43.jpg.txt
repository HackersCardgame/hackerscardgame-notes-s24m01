nightly erase of
relevant information(s)
([global] loop on Neuralink)

Inventor: ar:
IMHO there is a_ nightly (maybe global [generic|
personalized]) algorithm, that deletes relevant
information(s) like sentences [1] from @ioerror from the
mind of people or at least from my mind. Prerequisites
would be lots of data about a persons live, something like
Stimoceiver / Neuralink / US4877027 and specific algorithm
that would eg. show an image / stimulus on Neuralink for
the scene they would like to delete and causing pain at the
same time eg. with b1 Card... If true and one could record
what they try to delete we would maybe then know how
more how they manipulate the world.
