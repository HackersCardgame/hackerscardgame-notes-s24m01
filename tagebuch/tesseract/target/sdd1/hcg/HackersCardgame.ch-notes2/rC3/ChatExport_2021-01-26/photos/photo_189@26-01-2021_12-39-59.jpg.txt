They seem to have some sort of function on Stimoceiver,
Neuralink to detect if you try to find something.
That activates an eventtrigger that then samples the
person you fear most ($1940sShrink) say things like:
- Suchen bis gefunden (.mil Retohrical Automatism)
- HAHAHA, i hold it in my hand (+video Sample)

does he want, HAHAHA
(additional bl card is activated with the sample)

multiple times, co2->a16 In my particular case they seem
to have a fetish triggering that in private life, maybe they
hope, i would not leak it then... as you see, i would "not",
and if you talk about that they | even begin to render things
on your sex toys, that suxx even more
