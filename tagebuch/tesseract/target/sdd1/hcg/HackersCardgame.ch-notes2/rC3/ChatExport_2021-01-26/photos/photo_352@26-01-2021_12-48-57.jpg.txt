Switzerland has Drones, possibly attached also to
INTAF (t43 Card), possibly also using Military Fiber
Backbone (n3) and it is also likely that they have
SDR's mounted for the less nice things like t19 Card or
other "funny" things. Maybe they also can Control
NPC's with such drones like Michael B (Blick.ch called
him Grosimé6rder). | think it would be easy to find out if
swiss army had a reason to kill her with the hands of
her own grandchild... This is just speculation, but if t19
Card can be proven on such drones it would be likely
that they use them also for Behavioral "Sciences".
Good thing seems to be that they can not fly or only
reduced when it rains. So doing a bycicle tour by night
and rain sounds maybe like a bad idea, but maybe
isn't at all and one would find out about eg. t41
