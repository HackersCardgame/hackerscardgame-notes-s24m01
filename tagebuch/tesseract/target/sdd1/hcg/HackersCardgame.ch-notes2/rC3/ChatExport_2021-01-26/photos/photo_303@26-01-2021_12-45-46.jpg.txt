cee people start programming:

print "hello world"

Crafting Interpreters is in my OPINION one of the
best course one can do, since you don't just learn
programming, but you learn how to write a
programming language. Another good thing is that
they have the same lessions for python, java, C/C++
that helps to understand the concept knowledge.

But this course is maybe not the right thing if you
never wrote a line of code, but if you already wrote
some code it is a great course.
