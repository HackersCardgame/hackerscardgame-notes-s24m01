If something like Medulla Oblangata or Medulla
Spinalis implant (Spinal Cord implant) would exist,
they would need some sort of Matrice Operations
(Jacobi Matrices?) to calculate the Body Movement. In

steering me into singularities after about 15 minutes
after i started to do body care to make me hurt

that has an additional minus sign for that specific
axsis. But not yet sure about that.
