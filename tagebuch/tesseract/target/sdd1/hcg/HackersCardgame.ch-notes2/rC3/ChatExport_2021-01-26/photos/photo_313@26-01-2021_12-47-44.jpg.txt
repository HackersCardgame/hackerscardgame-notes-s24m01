Inventor: Hans Berger Year: ~1929
EEG was originally developed by neurologist Hans
Berger. The Brain Computer Interface is an EEG that
recognizes patterns of brain currents with software
(pattern recognition, Al, Deep Learning) and can
activate events e.g. to start the loT-Toaster or more
worse thigns like flushing your brain or starting a
SuicideDeathBot (card b4, a16) Today with more
computing power, there are much more possibilities
than in 1929.
If the interface is bidirectional things could become a
Self-fulfilling prophecy, (see card co2)
Can be used as lie detector or to control computer
read thoghts memory and read moods
/ relaxation, eg. NeuroSky MindWave
