Navigation How to install and run Ableton Live 10 on Debian

July 22, 2020

Back to Home
There are a few caveats to installing and running Ableton Live 10 on Linux, and I initially had some issues getting it working on Debian that | couldn't find

solutions for online. Here’s how | got it working:

1. Download Ableton Live 10 (Windows 64 Bit) From Ableton’s website

2. Extract the zip file
3. ou should now see a file called Setup.msi. Wine doesn't work with msi files, you'll need to install the package msitools to work with msi files: sudo

apt install msitools

4. Normally, to install an msi file, you would runmsiexec /i Setup.msi, however, that wasn’t working for me. It would just run for a few
seconds then finish with no output or results. Instead, run the msiextract command: msiextract Setup.msi.

5. You should now see two folders: Ableton and System64. You can move these two folders to wherever you want Ableton to be installed

6.Torun Ableton, use wine with a 64 bit prefix to run the Ableton exe file: WINEPREFIX=/path/to/wine64prefix wine
Ableton/Live\ 10\ Suite/Program/Ableton\ Live\ 10\ Suite.exe

Ableton should now be up and running!

Note: Online authorization probably won't work. Follow Ableton’s instructions for offline authorization to get your copy of Ableton authorized.
