Hearing system

Abstract

Sound is induced in the head of a person by radiating the head with microwaves in the range of 100
megahertz to 10,000 megahertz that are modulated with a particular waveform. The waveform
consists of frequency modulated bursts. Each burst is made up of ten to twenty uniformly spaced
pulses grouped tightly together. The burst width is between 500 nanoseconds and 100
microseconds. The pulse width is in the range of 10 nanoseconds to 1 microsecond. The bursts are
frequency modulated by the audio input to create the sensation of hearing in the person whose head
is irradiated.
