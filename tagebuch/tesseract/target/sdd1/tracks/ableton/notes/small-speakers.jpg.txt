Getting your mixes to translate well on small speakers can
be quite difficult. Try this...

Place an EQ on your master track and filter out everything
below 500Hz and everything above 5kHz. When you do
this, you should be able to still hear every instrument. If
they disappear, your mix won't translate well on smaller

speakers.
