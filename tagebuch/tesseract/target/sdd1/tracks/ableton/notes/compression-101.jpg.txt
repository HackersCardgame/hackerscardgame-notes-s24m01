Compression 101

~) (Â¥) Compressor

Threshold determines at what level the compressor starts reducing the dynamics.

Attack determines how long it takes for the compressorto reduce in volume. A fast
attack will push down peaks, a slow attack will push down tails.

Release determines how long it takes for the compressor to release the compression.
Audio levels recover much quicker with a fast release.

Knee determines how hard or soft the compression is working. You can use a soft
knee for a more natural sound, such as a piano, or a hard knee for a more intense
sound.

Ratio determines the strength of the dynamic reduction. The higher the ratio, the more
compression you get.
