You can ‘Glue’ your Drum Buss together by using
Compression, Reverb, and Saturation.

Compression will introduce common similarities between
each element in terms of dynamics.

Reverb will introduce a sense of space, which all
elements will sit in.

Saturation will introduce shared harmonics between each
element, which will make the sound thicker, while also
increasing headroom with perceived loudness.
