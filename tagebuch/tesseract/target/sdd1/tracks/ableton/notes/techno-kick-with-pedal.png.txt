TECHNO KICK WITH PEDAL

Start by selecting a kick with a long decay, followed by
an instance of Abletonâ€™s Pedal.

Choose the Distort setting, activate the Sub, and dial the
gain to taste.

For added Whack, move the mid-frequency knob to the
right-most position then boost the mid control. For added
thump, boost the bass.
