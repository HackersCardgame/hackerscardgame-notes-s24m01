During the build-up in your track, try automating the volume and
the Delay and Reverb Dry/Wet Knobs. Lowering the volume of
both the Volume and the Effects at the beginning of the build-up,
while increasing the amount until the end of the section will
providesome extra tension and make your drop sound much more
impactful.
