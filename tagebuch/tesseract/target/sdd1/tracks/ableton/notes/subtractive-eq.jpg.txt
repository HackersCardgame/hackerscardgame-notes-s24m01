Think of the frequency spectrum like a suitcase. Your goal is to

fit as much items into your suitcase as possible, each occupying

it's own space. But in this scenario instead of clothing, it’s the
frequencies of each indivual part of a track. With subtractive EQ,

you can specifically target unwanted and/or competing frequencies,
allowing each part to fit in it’s own individual space in the mix.
