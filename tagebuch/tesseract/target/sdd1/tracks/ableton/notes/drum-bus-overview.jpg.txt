DRUM BUSS OVERVIEW

The first panel on the left gives you access to input settings, compression, and 3
different distortion types.

The middle panel gives you access to mid-high frequency shaping tools that are
designed to add clarity and presence.

Crunch works like distortion and Damp is similar to a low pass filter.

The Transients knob modifies transients of frequencies above 100Hz.

The last panel on the right gives you access to some low-end enhnacement tools; a
resonant filter (made up of Boom and Freq knobs), as well as a Decay control.
