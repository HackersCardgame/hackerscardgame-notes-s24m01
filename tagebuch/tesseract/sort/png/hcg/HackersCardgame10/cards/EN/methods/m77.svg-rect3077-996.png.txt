with Neurosky MindWave you can read attenuation or
meditation, so we guess one electrode (tl card) would be
sufficient to extrapolate for example also the parameter
faith. This card was added after i leaked m57 Card...
There seems to be an algorithm, that records what one is
doing for example during a week, saves the good scenes
and then tries to create a Suicide Death Bot with this
inverted good scenes.

Additionally they seem to drop all connections from the
victims t1 to other allies, so no-one could help.

Workaround: Listen to music you love, | use wireless
headphones to not disturb my neighbors. | guess the
music makes it harder for the detection algorithms to
identify your emotions.
