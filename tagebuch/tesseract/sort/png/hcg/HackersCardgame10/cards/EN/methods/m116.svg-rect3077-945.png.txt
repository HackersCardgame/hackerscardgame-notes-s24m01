IMHO there is a_ nightly (maybe global [generic]
personalized]) algorithm, that deletes relevant
information(s) like sentences [1] from @ioerror from the
mind of people or at least from my mind. Prerequisites
would be lots of data about a persons live, something like
Stimoceiver / Neuralink / US4877027 and specific algorithm
that would eg. show an image / stimulus on Neuralink for
the scene they would like to delete and causing pain at the
same time eg. with b1 Card... If true and one could

we would maybe then know how
more how they manipulate the world.

.. [1] Basically the NSA (Marcjr: AND CIA), they
want to be able to spy on you (MarcJr: bidirectional), and if
they have 10 different options for spying on you that you
know about, they have 13 ways of doing it and they do all
13. (Marcjr: at the same time)
