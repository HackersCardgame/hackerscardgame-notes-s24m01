Design patterns are proven solution templates for
recurring design problems in architecture, in
software development and in Psychology / Sociology.
A design pattern usually contains several classes
(templates or objects). A single design pattern is a
collection of different such templates. E.g. The shape
of a single step of stairs AND the railing (steelwork
or eg woodwork) for the complete stairs AND for
example the shape for the carpet of a step.
