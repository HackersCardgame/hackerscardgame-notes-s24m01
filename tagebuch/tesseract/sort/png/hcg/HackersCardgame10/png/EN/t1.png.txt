Inventor: José Manuel Rodriguz Delgado ~1950

The newest versions Neuralink(Elon Musk, maybe HoneyPot)
read EEG data transmits signals to brain. Can activeate certain
functions in brain, wires in the Amygdala would probably cause
agressions (bl card). Active community (read only, and non-
invasive) on Twitter: @OpenBCl. Even things like directly "built-
in" Augmented Reality (Like PokemonGO) could be achieved with
such technologies. There are maybe other ways
W0O2005055579A1, US4877027... (HoneyPots?). Maybe sold as
lie detector (co2,m57,m77,m125...) reads thoughts & emotions,
influences emotions, automate/abuse victims, CryEngine / Unity
(m98,m99,t32,m60...) Warning, it seems that if you find
sources about this sort of things they upload Porn or
even Pedophilia Content to your computer and activate
the judges or m37 card...

Additional Disassembly Protection for the group m46 first as
shown as m41 over tl then m37 -> m46 -> dtl so people could
not integrate the existence of things like Stimoceiver in their
world view, Matthaeus::7::1
