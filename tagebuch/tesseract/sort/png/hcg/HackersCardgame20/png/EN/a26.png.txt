Inventor: xxxx Year! ~7??7??

They seem to stalk me 24h on my DBS / Neuralink.
As soon i find out relevant things they hunt me
down. Autistics love to solve puzzles, solving one
gives more information. This algorithm also seems to
work with telemetry. one can carry about 5 things.
But they can force me to try to carry 10 so that i get
problems. They must give me relevant infos because
the autistic brain would not accept irrelevant
information(s). So maybe paper and pen is my
friend. Combined with prostate implant, remote
tourette syndrom, spinal cord attacks. EventTrigger
on things like creating t46 card, Rawhammer Attack
of the mind, chemitrodes, blowing up my operatin
system, virtual intimidation (eg with guns) throug
older potentially peophile people (earlier attacks ->
PTBS -> revictimizing), induced epilepsy (PAIN ->
burns the scene in your mind)... "playing" this card
would imply that you just before found out
something relevant
