Kids unfortunately learn early that they must be the
fittest and the first. ("maybe" some parents and
technolgy cards induce that intentionally, see sk1l
card)
to avoid that behavior I repeat loud to myself
* first you win
* then you have fame
* then you are getting ignorant and lazy
* then you will have a knife in your back
Don't celebrate wins to much, there are lot young
people beeing abused and blackmailed by older
generations. Better invest time to rescue younger
victims. unknwon: The root of this useless behavior
is maybe the school, where different kids battle to
answer as first, and then remotely enjoy the fame
