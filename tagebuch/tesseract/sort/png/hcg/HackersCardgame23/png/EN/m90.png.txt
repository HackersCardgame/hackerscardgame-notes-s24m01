If one consumes Drugs it has definitively influence on the
neuro-endocrine system of this person. But things like
accessing other peoples, dissociating them, attacking
them virtually is possibly just the mainframe that detects
the changed neuro-endocrine system and_ gives
additional access rights on tl, eyel... Cards and the
mainframe it is attached to. Drugs also deactivates
critical thinking, and the mainframe will store of course
the things to blackmail the Drugs user later on. If one
consumes Drugs he will maybe have benefits for a short
while, but aslong as he does not confess he would be
owned and forced easily to do things he otherwise would
not.
