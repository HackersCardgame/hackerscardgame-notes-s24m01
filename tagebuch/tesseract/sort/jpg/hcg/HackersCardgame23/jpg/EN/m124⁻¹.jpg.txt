If one can prove the crimes of lower
ranked person of a bigger system like a
military dicatorship they somehow tend
to escalate this situation to the next
higher instance to get help.

If the higher instance would help them
this would rise some questions in case
of crimes, additional this is also some
sort of chosen plaintext attack that then
would lead to more leaks and more
details about the higher ranks of that
"super duper" System...
