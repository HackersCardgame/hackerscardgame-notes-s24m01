After a while, $Shrink shoots to many
CyberWeapons / electronical f
psychological Warfare Socio-
Psychology-Design-Patterns at me and
locked them. As soon as i would like to
protocol them he or his automated
targeting systgem shoots more at me. |
guess like real Odays for eg. Software
or Operating Systems they don't have
unlimited of this socio-psychology
Malware. So he must prevent that |
disassemble them. Otherwise we could
patch them. Any idea?
