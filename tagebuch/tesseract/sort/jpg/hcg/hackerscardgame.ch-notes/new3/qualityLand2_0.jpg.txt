So when we talk about this, we have to consider that this is designed for
at-scale exploitation. And as far as | can tell it’s being used for at-scale
exploitation. Which is not really in my mind a targeted particularized type
of thing, but rather it’s loperationsm—lgs expeditions. It’s more
like crusades, if you will. And in some cases, looking at the
evidence, that seems to be what it is. Targeting Muslims, | might add,
because that’s what they’re interested in doing.

So that said, that’s the internet, and we get all the way down to the
bottom and we get to the Close Access Operations and Off-Net. Off-Net
and Close Access Operations are pretty scary things, but basically this is
what we would call a black bag job. That’s where these guys, they break
into your house, they put something in your computer and they take other
things out of your computer.

Here’s an example. First top secret document of the talk so far.
