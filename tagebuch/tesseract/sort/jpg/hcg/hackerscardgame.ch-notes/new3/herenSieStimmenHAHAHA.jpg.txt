This paper briefly reviews current silent speech methodologies for normal and disabled individuals.
Current techniques utilizing electromyographic (EMG) recordings of vocal tract movements are useful
for physically healthy individuals but fail for tetraplegic individuals who do not have accurate
voluntary control over the speech articulators. Alternative methods utilizing EMG from other body ¢ Title & authors

normal conversation rates and require constant attention to a computer screen that provides visual
feedback and/or cueing. We present a novel approach to the problem of silent speech via an
intracortical microelectrode brain computer interface (BCI) to predict intended speech information
directly from the activity of neurons involved in speech production. The predicted speech is
synthesized and acoustically fed back to the user with a delay under 50 ms. We demonstrate that the
Neurotrophic Electrode used in the BCI is capable of providing useful neural recordings for over 4
years, a necessary property for BCls that need to remain viable over the lifespan of the user. Other
