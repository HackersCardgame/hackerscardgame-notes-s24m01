Real Person Speech

g
Inventor: XXXXX Year: ~222?

| guess there are some algorithms that are abused by $Shrink
and $herFather:

i often hear $herFather saying:

"Activate Booby Traps against Marc jr."

but all the others would hear the same but with my speech
synthesis and therefor they think that i would be the offender
not $herFather.

With deep fakes for speech synthesis this problem is even
more worse, but one can identify the real offender with
Natural Language Processing, Code Fingerprinting,
Psychology Fingerprinting. Autistic brains do this maybe
automatically, but not yet 100% sure about that.

Kibitz sample since ~2002: Terminator 2, Fake voice,
Auffrischungs"Spritze", Pivot-Element?
