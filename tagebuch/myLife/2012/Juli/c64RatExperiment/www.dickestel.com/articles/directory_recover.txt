Recovering a Lost Directory

by Dick Estel

A couple of times I have made panic calls to more experienced members of the group seeking help in
restoring a bad directory.  

The first time, I did a short format of a disk, which does NOT erase any files, but clears the directory
and makes the entire disk available for use.  I knew my files were intact, but I did not know how to get
the directory back.  This sort of thing can be done with a track and sector editor, but use of this is fairly
complicated and requires some knowledge that I did not have of how files are stored on a disk. 
Ultimately I recreated this disk from various other sources.  

Not long ago a 1581 disk with well over a hundred Doodle and Koala files took a dive.  I still do not
know what happened, but the result of trying to read the directory or load the files was the same as
doing it with a blank disk.

I had just read that issue 82 of Loadstar would have a program to recover disk directories, so I waited
impatiently for it to arrive.  When it finally came, I was dismayed to find it was only for 1541/1571
disks, but the documentation mentioned that Maverick has a directory recovery program also.

I promptly booted up Maverick and selected the Directory Recovery program from the menu.  I
followed the very simple instructions, put in my bad disk, and did something else while the program did
its work.  In a matter of a few minutes it was done, and when I tested the disk, everything was back to
normal, with all my files accessible.

If this ever happens to you, don't stomp the disk into the ground in frustration--just get out Loadstar or
Maverick, or call for help from one of our members who has these programs if you don't have them.
