## Landev's HackersCardgame License v1.0.0

### IF YOU DON'T RESPECT THIS LICENSE AND YOU ARE OLDER THAN ME (1978), YOU WILL MAYBE HURT ME OR EVEN DRIVE ME TO COMMIT SUICIDE, please respect this license.
This license replaces all previous licenses for all my works.

Satan tries to identify autistic people since at least 1980. He knows that they love to solve puzzles, and unfortunately, often such solved puzzles lead to leaks. Leaks are good for normal people, but the criminals really don't like leaks.

If one solves the puzzle...

"Strategic Mission J (economic espionage) was already robbing Swiss companies in 1997, before 9/11," that solves the puzzle "__Killing millions of innocent Muslims was just to distract Europe from the robbery__"

...they begin to do really bad things. They go against my sexual integrity, they often try brainjacking, and they also attack my imaginary and real friends as soon as I contact them to create avoidance behavior in my friends from even talking to me.

All kids that are younger than I (1978) should not feel bad and are definitely not responsible for what the older people did to me and are not responsible for these things. They even try to make autistics look like criminals, and if you are much younger than I, then it's even better for you that you let the people think that you judge me. This hurts my feelings, but it's better than risking the lifes of younger people. I stopped deciding things; I let the calculations decide for me.

__It's a dual license__:

*   For people the same age or younger than me, ALL my content shall be free under GPL or Creative Commons License.

*   For people older than me: you will not even get a license if you would give me 1 Billion $
    -> That's not meant mean; it's just that it would be likely that if you read, scan, track record, and store and manipulate my content, then I would commit suicide.

In both cases, there are exceptions I named in earlier licenses explicitly.

You will only understand my complete mindset if:

-    You don't have access or even own a weapon, does not matter if Atomic Bomb, Tank ... Gun, Knife (maybe except a kitchen knife or Swiss army knife for, e.g., fixing stuff like computers, toaster, sex-toys...)

-    If you don't attack people (especially not younger), whether physically nor verbally nor with things like Cyberwar.
**(If you just defended yourself, it is maybe okay, but if you agree for revenge, then they will blackmail you even if you only think of revenge, Fuzzy Trace Theory, Neuralink, Big Data, Data Retention.)

*    Throwing stuffed animals is completely okay (be careful plush tux, they are aerodynamic so they lose their impulse slower and hurt more)

*    If you try your best to avoid CO2 emissions

*    If you (you don't need to take an oath) agree to the Hippocratic oath

*    If you honestly try not to be ignorant to younger people

*    If you are not a pedophile, neither in thoughts nor physically

*    If you help to defend all younger people against cyberWar, Cyber-rape, or real rape...
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hacker_ethic#Protect_younger_people

*    If you respect feminism but also that young boys (especially in male-dominated economies) need protection too

*    If you consume such content only consume "kosher" content... (Normally, you recognize, if content was made consensual or not)
(I'm influenced by Pizza Gate and Adrenochrome Topic, that is just the nearest match young people find on the WW3 to express that their parents are somehow ArrayList<curse_word_Nous>)

###    If you produce such Content:

*    Only produce "kosher" = consensual content (Christian variant of kosher)

*    Pain is maybe okay but violence is definitely not

*    If you would produce non-consensual and violent porn, then you would maybe poison even the soul of younger people

*    Don't create or use porn from people from your local social system; they would abuse it maybe to blackmail you, and would rise tons of unpleasant situations and even trigger suicide attempts if, e.g., you've been abused by old people, and they then would even consume your most private scenes that would be one of the main reasons for me to commit suicide. That's the reason why many of __this sort of websites__ have the option ...

[x] don't show in your own country.

If you think you should be excluded from the "1978 and younger"-Rule, you can contact me on Twitter @PinkyDef. (~~@FailDef~~)
