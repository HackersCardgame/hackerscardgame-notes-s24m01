it's a very honest video

you ask "Why i am alone?"
- i mean i'm alone too, it's partitionally because i did stupid things but was never mean or violent

the reasons i found is that:
- people have kids
- filter bubble, algorithm can not cathegorize you to any group, 
- once a person is out of his peering group it's very hard to get back to the group
- calling people sinners is also not helpful even if it is true, people use their time to get the biggest share in their company or anywhere else
- people are often egoists, being egoistic help's them not to suffer. being an egoist is some sort of selfe protection
- you say that your brain thinks faster, that also implies that you think more about moral things than other people do
- people are distracted by their job, no time to socialise, a job is a place where people meet, so in the evening the need their rest and are maybe happy to be alone
- dont talk about v2k, it would make the people fear and would show avoidance behavior to talk to you because of the fear
- if you read books from Jürgen Habermass: often people act strategic, that means that they thread people like they are objects, and if they would like to have more wage or a better position in the job they must invest time and socialize with the chief, because a random schizophrenic like me can not improve their situation in job, so many people think of other peoples like variables from an equation
- if one out of 100 schizophrenic runs amok people normally say "he run amok because he is a schizophrenic" not analyzing what lead to the amok run. it's some sort of lazynes of people not analyzing this sort of things and build common sense in generalizing eg. to schizophrenic or to another minority. statistically there are 1% schizophrenic people in the world, 99% are not, so why should they try to understand schizophrenic people, why should the ecconomy or the algorithms care for the 1% of schizophrenic, they dont, it's about busines with the rest of the 99% ignoring the 1% of schizophrenic or other minorities
- corona lockdown made everything worse
- maybe having same interests help to find people that would like to spend time with you. for example i could show you how i work in ableton or you could show me how to work with frutiloops

No messages on twitter / Facebook
- many people left facebook / twitter, i mean they did not delete the profile but not using it anymore
- some hang around in telegram messenger


if you read the german book "die Inklusionslüge" they talk about history of mental institutions, they were never ment to include people, since many centuries people that do not fit into the normal consumer behavior are separated
